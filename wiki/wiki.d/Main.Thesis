While this class should be directly accessible from a CS computer, I (ash) had some problems. However, the good people at LASER made all the files available as a tar ball, so I downloaded it and put all the files in the same directory as my thesis. %0a%0a'''Other paperwork'''\\%0aMake sure you start taking care of all the paperwork with time to spare.  In my experience, the grad school keeps a file for you so%0acan drop things off over time. See the [[http://www.umass.edu/gradschool/index.htm | UMass Grad School]] site, for requirements, dates, what not. %0a%0a'''The process'''\\%0aI (ash) gave a complete thesis to my committee two weeks before my defense,%0awhich is what's usually recommended. However, if you're pressed for%0atime, you can give them an incomplete version (depending on the%0acommittee), e.g., without a discussion section.%0a%0a%0aYou have to upload a .pdf of your thesis to some third-party%0aorganization. The process took me about ten minutes, if that. %0a%0aMe (ash) and Ozgur submitted our theses on August 29, 2008, for a%0aSeptember 2008 graduation date. The submission process consisted of%0atwo parts: 1) some paperwork, including signature pages (acid free),%0amust be handed into the grad school (Goodell), 2) upload a pdf of the%0athesis. As it turns out, part 1 must be handed in by 5pm, but part 2%0acan be uploaded by 11:59pm (this was confirmed when I called the grad%0aschool and asked them outright). I uploaded mine by 10pm that%0anight. However, Ozgur figured out you even have a few more days if you%0aneed it. Basically, if you think you'll need a few more days for%0arevisions, talk to people at the grad school and ask them. %0a%0aFinally, I (ash) was under the impression that, after they looked over%0ayour thesis for formatting problems, they would give you another%0achance to make modifications. You can, but they won't explicitly offer%0ayou that chance. I recieved an email in November 08 saying that they%0alooked over the formatting and everything was fine. I called them and%0asaid I found a few typos and was there a way to make those%0acorrections? The person I spoke to was new, so she asked someone%0aelse. The answer is "you're in trouble" and that they would allow me%0ato upload another version if I did it that day and called them and%0atold them that I did that. It wasn't worth it to me to do that as I%0ahadn't finished looking over everything, so I just let it go. %0a%0a%0a%0a%0a
