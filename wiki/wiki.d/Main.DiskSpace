text=!!! Disk Space%0a%0aThis page describes the different types of disk space and what appropriate to put on the different disks. There are basically three types of disk space:%0a# Local Disk Space - never backed up, put whatever you want on it%0a# User Partitions - backed up about 3 times a week, is typically your home directory. For example, Ash's is /nfs/entropy/u2/ash or ~ash (same thing). You should be frugal with this space -- only put stuff that is worthy of being backed up 3 times a week on it.%0a# Data Partitions - this gets back up less frequently, has the name p_some_ _number_ in it. Typically for data. %0a%0aTo find out how much disc space you have...%0a* Disk space and file size%0a** du is the command for "disk usage," df is the command for "disk free," as in how much free space (it might take a few seconds or a minute).%0a*** du -sh name_of_directory_or_file will give you the size of the directory in human readable numbers%0a*** df name_of_directory will give the disk usage and free space of all paritions associated with that directory. if you have no argument (just df), it will give all partitions%0a%0a%0aThe types of disc space you have available are described in more detail below.%0a%0a%0aThe most frequently used disk space in the lab sits on Entropy, the lab file server. The machine is an apple, but running linux, and sits down in the machine room in the CSCF area of the building. There is also local disk space on each desktop computer.%0a%0a* '''Local Disk Space''' - This is the actual hard drive on the actual computer. It's path should be /scratch.  You should put a lot of stuff on it, but it doesn't get backed up ever. You can access the local hard drive on another computer by sshing into it and then going to /scratch. Writing to space on the local computer is faster than writing to disk space on entropy. If you have a job which will be writing a lot of data, this is probably the best place to write it initially, though it takes a little extra work. You must create local directories with the same path on each machine you will be running experiments on, so, for example, I could create "/scratch/pippin/mydata" directories on each machine in the lab, then let my autoson process write to this directory. After the processes are finished, you must collate results from each machine.%0aLocation: local to each machine %0aUse: temporary data (and mp3s) %0aBacked up: never %0aAmount of space: lots, but depends on the machine. Check using df.%0a%0a* '''User Partitions''' - directories with u# in the name are typically user directories. %3cbr>%0aLocation: mounted from entropy %0aUse: user home directories %0aBacked up: frequently%0aAmount of space: typically 4 G divided between 2-3 students. If you use up all the space on your partition, other students will not be able to do work. Believe it or not, this has happened and surely will happen again.%0a%0a* '''Project/Data Partitions''' - directories with p# in the name are typically user directories. %0aLocation: mounted from entropy %0aUse: p4: group software and shared data only. others: any data (typically experimental data)%0aBacked Up: once a week %0aAmount of space: varies.

You should put a lot of stuff on it, but it doesn't get backed up ever. You can access the local hard drive on another computer by sshing into it and then going to /user/sl0. Writing to space on the local computer is faster than writing to disk space on entropy. If you have a job which will be writing a lot of data, this is probably the best place to write it initially, though it takes a little extra work. You must create local directories with the same path on each machine you will be running experiments on, so, for example, I could create "/user/sl0/pippin/mydata" directories on each machine in the lab, then let my autoson process write to this directory. After the processes are finished, you must collate results from each machine.%3cbr>%0a%3c Location: local to each machine %3cbr>%0a%3c Use: temporary data (and mp3s) %3cbr>%0a%3c Backed up: never %3cbr>%0a%3c Amount of space: lots, but depends on the machine.
