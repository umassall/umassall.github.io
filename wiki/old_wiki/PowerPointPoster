!How to print a poster using powerpoint (Mac OSX)

Basially, you lay out the poster in powerpoint, transfer it to a windows machine in cscf, and print it from there. They say to give yourself a day to print. I say, give yourself two or three days.

# Open powerpoint and set the page size to custom - what you want the dimensions of the poster to be. One dimension cannot be more thatn 36 inches, as that's the width of the poster paper (it's on a roll). However, we've encountered problems with a 36 inch poster, so make it a little smaller (34 or 35 inches). Also, you need 1.5 inch margins. I add vertical and horizontal lines to mark the margins, and remove them before printing.

# Lay it all out in power point, making sure the sides, top, and bottom have 1.5 inches of white space. For figures, jpgs do not blow up well. So, I hope you have vectorized pdf or eps files of your pictures. I say vectorized because making a pdf or eps out of a jpg doesn't cut it. What I did was lay out the poster using jpgs or something as placeholders. Then, when I have a good idea of the dimensions of the pictures, I go downstairs. I use photoshop to open up the pdf or eps file to the correct dimensions (actually, a little bigger than I need). I save that as an uncompressed tiff, and put those tiffs in powerpoint. Tiffs are large and will make printing a slow process. If you can, it's better to actually turn that pdf or eps into a compressed jpg or something, but you'll have to decide what trade off between quality and reduced size you want.

# For whatever reason, there are problems when printing a poster from a Mac. Printing directly from powerpoint on a Mac doesn't work. Printing a pdf from powerpoint from a Mac doens't work either. So, the best bet is to go to a windows machine in cscf and open up your poster in powerpoint there. You will likely have to redo so stuff, as the formatting isn't always conserved when switching between OS's.

# When your ppt poster looks nice on the Windows machine downstairs, ask someone from cscf to help you print it to the poster. You will have to set custom page sizes, select best quality, click on a scale to fit page, and do some other things that may or may not make sense. Some of these things were learned by trial and error, and we do not know why we have to do it. However, cscf should be able to help, as they help everyone print their posters.

# Printing takes a while. To spool an 8M poster, it took 45 minutes. That means 45 minutes passed before printing even started, and that when no one else was trying to print. It will then take maybe 30 minutes more to print a 50 inch poster. You then have to wait for it to dry, and the poster printer cuts the paper itself.

[The cscf page | http://www.cs.umass.edu/cf/public/posterp-powerpoint-osx.htm] describing how to print from power point on Max OSX. However, the stuff I wrote above is more current. This webpage says to save the poster as a pdf, which will automatically be saved in a pdf for preview, the Max OSX pdf viewer. Then, it says to open it up in Adobe Acrobat, and save it as an Acrobat pdf. However, that sometimes screws up the images. Slightly, but enough to scream.

Here are a couple example posters:

* [ppt of Khash and Ash's Coarticulation Poster | http://www-all.cs.umass.edu/Posters/Coart.ppt], 30" x 42.5".

* [ppt of the ALL poster (spring 06) | http://www-all.cs.umass.edu/Posters/ALL_Poster.ppt], 34" x 50".

* The ALL logo color schemes are: (in RGB): (0, 0, 102) for the dark blue and (153, 153, 255) for the light blue; (in CMYK): (98,82,8,25) for the dark blue and (39,26,0,0) for the light blue.

Why should you give yourself two or three days to print? Well, many things can go wrong, no one has all the answers, other people might be trying to print, they might have problems, there might be hardware or software issues, etc. Don't be an idiot. It says here: give yourself two or three days to print.
