This is the code I used to just submit a job to be run on limbic I'll break it down piece by piece

auadd -hosts @limbic -log logfile program

-auadd - sends the job to autoson to be added.

- -hosts @limbic - says I want the job to be run on limbic

- -log logfile - indicates the name of the logfile I want to use for any output from this experiment

-program - is what I would normally do to run the program

Here's a concrete example that I used to run a java program:


auadd -hosts @limbic -log run2test.out java -Xprof -server -ea -Xmx512M Ghmm ~GeneHmm.model ../../../research/synthesis/data/shorttrain ../../../research/synthesis/data/testonefile
