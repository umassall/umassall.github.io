!Printing a Poster

* The most important thing is to allow _*plenty of time*_ (like, two or three days) just to print. Sometimes it takes an hour, sometimes it takes three days. This is because others may be printing as well, and the printer might be jammed with jobs or they might screw things up. (We never do, of course.)

* *Before you print*, walk downstairs and talk to someone in cscf. Also, you should monitor the progress. When it's done, you must sign a sheet saying how much paper you used. It will take a while (an hour or two if things go well).

* Instructions for printing a poster using [Adobe InDesign | InDesignPoster] (which is awesome, once you learn it) or [PowerPoint (Mac OSX) | PowerPointPoster].

* Here are CMYK values (%) for the ALL logo dark blue and light blue colors: Dark Blue: (100, 98.43, 20.78, 31.37). Light Blue: (42.35, 39.22, 0, 0).

* When printing a poster longer than 4 ft long do not use CSCF computers using gimp-print.  There is a 4ft long print limit.  The windows computers in CSCF will work for this poster.

* Generally the rule is that CSCF likes you to print from their machines.  However, Ash has printed from spiny with no problem.  So if things are not working from their machine spiny should work.

!How to print a poster using powerpoint (Mac OSX)

Basially, you lay out the poster in powerpoint, transfer it to a windows machine in cscf, and print it from there. They say to give yourself a day to print. I say, give yourself two or three days.

# Open powerpoint and set the page size to custom - what you want the dimensions of the poster to be. One dimension cannot be more thatn 36 inches, as that's the width of the poster paper (it's on a roll). However, we've encountered problems with a 36 inch poster, so make it a little smaller (34 or 35 inches). Also, you need 1.5 inch margins. I add vertical and horizontal lines to mark the margins, and remove them before printing.

# Lay it all out in power point, making sure the sides, top, and bottom have 1.5 inches of white space. For figures, jpgs do not blow up well. So, I hope you have vectorized pdf or eps files of your pictures. I say vectorized because making a pdf or eps out of a jpg doesn't cut it. What I did was lay out the poster using jpgs or something as placeholders. Then, when I have a good idea of the dimensions of the pictures, I go downstairs. I use photoshop to open up the pdf or eps file to the correct dimensions (actually, a little bigger than I need). I save that as an uncompressed tiff, and put those tiffs in powerpoint. Tiffs are large and will make printing a slow process. If you can, it's better to actually turn that pdf or eps into a compressed jpg or something, but you'll have to decide what trade off between quality and reduced size you want.

# For whatever reason, there are problems when printing a poster from a Mac. Printing directly from powerpoint on a Mac doesn't work. Printing a pdf from powerpoint from a Mac doens't work either. So, the best bet is to go to a windows machine in cscf and open up your poster in powerpoint there. You will likely have to redo so stuff, as the formatting isn't always conserved when switching between OS's.

# When your ppt poster looks nice on the Windows machine downstairs, ask someone from cscf to help you print it to the poster. You will have to set custom page sizes, select best quality, click on a scale to fit page, and do some other things that may or may not make sense. Some of these things were learned by trial and error, and we do not know why we have to do it. However, cscf should be able to help, as they help everyone print their posters.

# Printing takes a while. To spool an 8M poster, it took 45 minutes. That means 45 minutes passed before printing even started, and that when no one else was trying to print. It will then take maybe 30 minutes more to print a 50 inch poster. You then have to wait for it to dry, and the poster printer cuts the paper itself.

[The cscf page | http://www.cs.umass.edu/cf/public/posterp-powerpoint-osx.htm] describing how to print from power point on Max OSX. However, the stuff I wrote above is more current. This webpage says to save the poster as a pdf, which will automatically be saved in a pdf for preview, the Max OSX pdf viewer. Then, it says to open it up in Adobe Acrobat, and save it as an Acrobat pdf. However, that sometimes screws up the images. Slightly, but enough to scream.

Here are a couple example posters:

* [ppt of Khash and Ash's Coarticulation Poster | http://www-all.cs.umass.edu/Posters/Coart.ppt], 30" x 42.5".

* [ppt of the ALL poster (spring 06) | http://www-all.cs.umass.edu/Posters/Coart.ppt], 34" x 50".

* The ALL logo color schemes are: (in RGB): (0, 0, 102) for the dark blue and (153, 153, 255) for the light blue; (in CMYK): (98,82,8,25) for the dark blue and (39,26,0,0) for the light blue.

Why should you give yourself two or three days to print? Well, many things can go wrong, no one has all the answers, other people might be trying to print, they might have problems, there might be hardware or software issues, etc. Don't be an idiot. It says here: give yourself two or three days to print.

Click [here | PosterProblems] to find out why you should leave yourself *TWO WHOLE DAYS* to print a poster. This includes other people's problems and their "solutions."

[The cscf page | http://www.cs.umass.edu/cf/public/posterp-powerpoint-osx.htm] describing how to print from power point on Max OSX. Do not ask why, but you should follow the instructions exactly.

Basically, set it all up in power point (read the above link) and then talk to cscf when you want to print. They'll walk you through the process, and it's always different for different people because the poster printer demon who makes our lives miserable is brilliant and invents new ways for things to not work.

Here are examples of the Coarticulation poster Khash and Ash did in October 2005. They might be helpful as a starting point. Others, please add your own as well...

* [Final .ppt version | http://www-all.cs.umass.edu/Coart_poster_Oct05/Coart.ppt] This is 30" x 42.5" and contains tiffs. We printed it from a Windows machine (after making some minor edits) in cscf, but that did not work on the first try either. Don't really know why.

* [Final .pdf version | http://www-all.cs.umass.edu/Coart_poster_Oct05/Coart-final.pdf] a pdf of the same thing.

* [Large .ppt version | http://www-all.cs.umass.edu/Coart_poster_Oct05/CoartBIG.ppt] The 36" x 51" version.

* [Large with lines .ppt version | http://www-all.cs.umass.edu/Coart_poster_Oct05/Coart_lines_eps.ppt] This version is 36" x 51" and has eps figures (thus, they don't show up on the .ppt slide and only print on a ps printer). However, the reason why it's hear is because this version includes guide lines I made. Powerpoint does not allow you to create guide lines -- you can only move one horizontal guide and one vertical guide. Thus, you have to make your own. If you're doing a 36" poster (if they can get it so it works), these guides are decent.
