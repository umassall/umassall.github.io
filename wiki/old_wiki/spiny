Spiny is the mac in the common area. We bought it for two main reasons, which take precedence over other uses:
# video conferencing (top priority)
# to have a non-linux computer so we can use MS Products (we have office) and Adobe (we have creative suite, including photoshop, indesign, and acrobat professional).
<BR>
When you video conference, please email the lab to give them warning that you'll be video conferencing as it's fairly annoying (I assume... I think I was the only one who VC'd...)

While the above two uses take precedence, we don't video conference or use the non-linux features most of the time. Therefore, feel free to use spiny to run stuff (it's fast).
<BR><br>
That being said, here are some things you should know and do with your account on spiny:
# [Login Problems with spiny | LoginSpiny]
# [Set the default printer on spiny | SetPrinterSpiny]
# [Back ups on spiny | BackupSpiny]
# [Misc problems | MiscSpiny]

That being said, here are some things you should know:
* Mac OSX does not cooperate with being networked, at least the way we do it in the dept. To log in, you go down to "Other" on the log in screen and use your ALL username and password. Something called LDAP allows spiny to communicate with entropy so that it will recognize your ALL username and password. However, this doesn't always work: sometimes it doesn't recognize them. When this happens, you can wait a few minutes (literally, not a few seconds) and try again, or reboot spiny and wait a few minutes before trying again.
* To enable usage without needing LDAP, we set up local accounts. There's an ALLGuest account, which does not require a password, a general ALL account with a password, an ALLadmin account, which has administrative priveleges, and a CSCF account. Also, people who want it can have their own local accounts. Talk to Ash if you want one.
* You should be able to ssh into spiny from your shell on a linux machine. For example, Ash would type >ssh ash@spiny.cs.umass.edu to access his LDAP-linked account on spiny. To access his local account on spiny, which he names spinyash, he would type >ssh spinyash@spiny.cs.umass.edu.
* We're not quite sure what you can and what you can't run remotely on spiny.
* One time, a window kept appearing saying that spiny wasn't backed-up. This window kept appearing and made the computer unusable. The problem was that the date was set wrong, and it wasn't updating. Here is a fix for that if it happens again:
<verbatim>
 you can log in remotely over the terminal and set the date
and time using the date command. You will need to use sudo for
permission. For example, to set the date to be March 21, 2006 at 2:00 PM
you would enter the following command -

sudo date 032114002006

You will be prompted for your password and when you enter it the
date/time will be set.
