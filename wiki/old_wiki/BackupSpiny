! Backing up stuff on spiny

We can back up 2.5G on spiny. We've reached the limit. The default backup
setting was to backup everything under every user account. However, I've
changed it to "Custom," in which you must specifiy which folders get backed up.
Right now, no folders are getting backed up. If you want stuff on spiny to be
backed up, you must customize it yourself. Please do not go overboard if you do
so.

If you wish to specify folders on spiny to be backed up, [ read this | http://www.cs.umass.edu/cf/tech/backups.htm#t30]
(some cscf web pages are only viewable by a umass or cs.umass computer).

If you need admin privs on spiny, I have the password. It's not the usual one
we use for general low-security ALL password stuff.
