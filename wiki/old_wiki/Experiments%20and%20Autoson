* When running experiments (_e.g._, 30 runs of the same thing), it's best to use Autoson, which automatically runs jobs across all of the computers we have access to or some subset of them. If you've never used it before, be prepared to spend an hour or so figuring it out. Click on this [Autoson] link for links that will help you get started.
