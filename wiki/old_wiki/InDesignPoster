!Printing a Poster using Adobe ~InDesign

* You'll need to spend some time learning ~InDesign. Click [here | InDesignBasics] for a very basic introduction.

* When you open up a new document in ~InDesign, you must specify the page size. The poster paper is on a roll that is 3 feet wide, so the max dimension of the poster is 3 feet. Deal with it. Suppose the poster is 4 feet wide by 3 feet high (as will be the case for the sample poster to follow). Make sure the margins are set to 1.5 inches on all borders (necessary for our poster printer).

* After you make the poster in ~InDesign, talk to someone in cscf before you print it. Generally, they like to print posters from a cscf computer, so you should follow their lead. However, as another option, you can print directly from ~InDesign on spiny (Ash has done it). This is how, but get the OK from cscf first:
<verbatim>
Go to File -> Print
- set the printer to Poster
- General:
  Create a custom paper size:
      Page Set Up
      Paper Size
        Manage Custom Sizes
          Click on the "+" in a box sign
          name the paper size
          set the width and height (corresponding to your poster)
          set the printer margines to zero (the margins should have
            been taken care of in your document)
- Set Up:
  Paper Size: Defined by Driver (do not try to set to something else)
  Make sure the orientation is what you want.
- Should be all set to click on Print.

Walk downstairs and talk to someone in cscf before you click on Print.
