This plugin will "include" other pages in this wiki. In the language of hypertext this is called <i>transclusion</i>. The pages will render in distinct tables. You can also load external pages in a more limited fashion with the FrameIncludePlugin. Examples:

<?plugin IncludePage page="HomePage" ?>

<?plugin IncludePage page="WabiSabi" ?>
