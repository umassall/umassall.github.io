To add a new page to Wiki, all you have to do is come up with a
meaningful title, capitalize all the words and
StringThemTogetherLikeThis. Wiki automagically recognizes it as a
hyperlink. Alternatively, you can put anything into [square brackets]. Please follow the policy of choosing short names for pages, and be sure to StringThemTogetherLikeThis. Long page names with spaces and lower case letters break the uniformity of the Wiki, and are thus aesthetically unappealing. On the actual page, spaces are inserted before capitalized letters, so there is never any need to put spaces in a page title. If you want the text in the link to be different from the title of the page, enter the link to the page like this:

<verbatim>
 [Link name can be whatever you like | LinkLocation]
</verbatim>

Then you can go ahead and ClickTheQuestionMark at the end of your new
hyperlink, and the Wiki will give you a window for making the new
page.

If you wish to add documents with complex markup to the Wiki, you
might be better off providing a URL to it than trying to add the text
of the document here, like so:

PhpWiki project homepage: http://phpwiki.sourceforge.net/

The Wiki does not support HTML tags (see TextFormattingRules).
<tags>They will just render like text.</tags> Wiki is meant to be as
simple as possible to encourage use.

Note that there is a feature that your system administrator can enable
to allow embedded HTML, but there are security risks involved.
