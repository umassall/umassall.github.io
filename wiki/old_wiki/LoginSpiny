! Logging into spiny

Mac OSX does not cooperate with being networked, at least the way we do it in the dept. To log in, you go down to "Other" on the log in screen and use your ALL username and password. Something called LDAP allows spiny to communicate with entropy so that it will recognize your ALL username and password. However, this doesn't always work: sometimes it doesn't recognize them. When this happens, you can wait a few minutes (literally, not a few seconds) and try again, or reboot spiny and wait a few minutes before trying again.

To enable usage without needing LDAP, we set up local accounts. There's an ALLGuest account, which does not require a password, a general ALL account with a password, an ALLadmin account, which has administrative priveleges, and a CSCF account. Also, people who want it can have their own local accounts. Talk to Ash if you want one.

You should be able to ssh into spiny from your shell on a linux machine. For example, Ash would type >ssh ash@spiny.cs.umass.edu to access his LDAP-linked account on spiny. To access his local account on spiny, which he names spinyash, he would type >ssh spinyash@spiny.cs.umass.edu.

We're not quite sure what you can and what you can't run remotely on spiny.
