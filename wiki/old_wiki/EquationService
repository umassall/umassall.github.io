I found this cool program for Mac OS X that lets you type little snippets of code in LaTeX and typeset them into little pdf's which you can then drag into any program that recognizes pdf's (e.g. OmniGraffle). It took all of 30 seconds to setup and produce a little pdf when I found it. It's pretty neat. Here's the link:
