! Misc problems and solutions with spiny

# One time, a window kept appearing saying that spiny wasn't backed-up. This window kept appearing and made the computer unusable. The problem was that the date was set wrong, and it wasn't updating. Here is a fix for that if it happens again:
<verbatim>
 you can log in remotely over the terminal and set the date
and time using the date command. You will need to use sudo for
permission. For example, to set the date to be March 21, 2006 at 2:00 PM
you would enter the following command -

sudo date 032114002006

You will be prompted for your password and when you enter it the
date/time will be set.

(03 month 21 day 14 hour 00 minutes 2006 year)
</verbatim>
