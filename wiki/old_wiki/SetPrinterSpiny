!Set the default printer on Spiny

To prevent accidental printing to other printers (especially the poster printer!), set *allprinter* to be the default printer on your account on spiny:
     # open "System Preferences"
     # click on "Print & Fax" under "Hardware," the second row
     # bring up the "Printing" menu (left of the three options near the top
     # under "Selected Printer in Print Dialog," which is near the bottom, select "allprinter," as opposed to "last printer used."
