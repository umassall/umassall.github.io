! Printing Stuff

Set "allprinter" to be the default printer under your account on spiny: Open "System Preferences," click on "Print & Fax" (under Hardware, the second row), bring up the "Printing" menu, and select "allprinter" under "Selected Printer in Print Dialog" (as opposed to "last printer used).

To print multiple postscript sheets per page, use mpage (linux command) like so:
<verbatim>
   > mpage -2cfo files > foo.ps
   > lpr foo.ps
</verbatim>
(this prints two sheets side by side on a landscape sheet).
<BR>
To print multipl ascii sheets per page,
<verbatim>
> a2ps file -o foo.ps
> mpage -1cfo foo.ps > tmp.ps
> lpr tmp.ps
</verbatim>
(no, you cannot print directly from a2ps, as some parts get cut off, but using mpage makes it OK again)
<BR>

The command
<verbatim>
> mpage -1cfo foo.ps > tmp.ps
</verbatim>
also helps if the file foo.ps is formatted such that it gets cut-off when printed out (as is the case with some downloaded papers).
<BR><BR>
To print multiple pages of pdf files per one printed page (like for printing lecture slides), you must use "Preview," the Mac pdf viewer (unless someone knows a better way, that is). Use a mac to open the pdf file in Preview, go to File->Print, Click on "Copies and Pages" near the top of the window, select the pages per sheet options that you want. Make sure to also make it print double sided (by selecting either long edge or short edge binding).
<BR>

To make your printing (from a linux machine) be double-sided automatically, put this in your .cshrc file: " setenv PRINTER allprinter-double " . You can print single-sided by printing via lpr -P allprinter. By the way, if you print to woper and want double-sided, do lpr -Pwoper-double or something like that.
