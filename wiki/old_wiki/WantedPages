Here is a list of pages that have been cited on this wiki but are not
yet written. Although they appear to be wanted, they may be
misspellings of existing pages or pages too trivial to merit creation.

The best course of action for these pages isn't necessarily to create
a page. Often, it is better to change the references so they are no
longer ~WikiNames. Where applicable, you can just change the case, add
spaces or insert an escape character ~~.
