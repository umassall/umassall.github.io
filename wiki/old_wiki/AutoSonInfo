This page describes how to do more stuff. Unless otherwise noted, type the commands in your shell.

* aulook: lists the job and machine they're running on.

* aulook -group or aulook -g : lists every possible machine or group.

* augui : brings up the the graphical interface.

* to delete an entry: (as of now, Ash can't make auzap work)
  # use aulook to see at which machine the job is running
  # ssh to that machine
  # use ps x to see what the PID #s related to that job are
  # kill the PID #s (kill #####)
  # double check by logging out and doing aulook


* for some reason, Ash had problems with the shell variable "TASK_NUM" (click [here | http://www-anw.cs.umass.edu/ash_runs_autoson.txt] to see the shell script). I had to manually ssh to a machine, setenv TASK_NUM to some number, and then the shell script would work. this didn't always happen, but Emily, goddess that she is, suggested that I simply setenv TASK_NUM in my .cshrc file. This seemed to work

* also note: in order for you job to be run on a machine through autoson, you must be able to run that job on that machine yourself. For example, Ash cannot run his matlab scripts on machines that he cannot ssh to and run matlab on manually.
