The RedirectToPlugin can be used to redirect a user to another page.
In other words it makes a page an _alias_ for another page.

! Arguments

Use only one of these arguments at a time.

page |
  The page to redirect to (a wiki page name).
href |
  An external URL to redirect to.  Redirection to external URLs will only work
  on locked pages.  (If the URL contains funny characters, you'll probably have
  to put quotes around the URL.)

! Caveats

The RedirectToPlugin invocation must be the first thing on a page.
For most purposes it makes any other content on the page inaccessible.

! Example

A page may be made a alias for the HomePage by placing this code at the top:
<verbatim>
<?plugin RedirectTo page="HomePage" ?>
</verbatim>

To see the example in action, visit HomePageAlias.
