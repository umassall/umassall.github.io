The lab has a laptop for lab use. Right now, this is Dopamine, a Mac Powerbook. It's locked away in a cabinet drawer, and someone (Kim) has a key. Be sure to sign it in and out if you use it.

There are two accounts available to lab members. One is password protected: the username is Alliens and the password is all266. The other is not. It's called allguest and has limited access.
