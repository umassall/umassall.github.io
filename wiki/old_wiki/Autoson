When running experiments (e.g., 30 runs of the same thing), it's best to use Autoson, which automatically runs jobs across all of the computers we have access to or some subset of them. If you've never used it before, be prepared to spend an hour or so figuring it out.

Autoson automatically runs jobs across machines and what not. Here are some links to help you out.

Emily Horrell in LPR is the current expert, though you can ask Ashvin or probably many other people as well. However, don't do so until you've skimmed through all this stuff and tried to run it yourself, otherwise Ash will get mad.
