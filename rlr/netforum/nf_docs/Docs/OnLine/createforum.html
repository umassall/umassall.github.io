Create a Forum</H2>
<HR>

 To create a forum, select
 the "Create a Forum" icon.
When you click on this item, you will be presented with a form asking you for
all the forum
information:
<ul>
<li> <b>Forum name:</b> The full name of the forum, e.g. "Technical support Forum"
<li> <b>Code name to be appended to URL:</b> 
This is what the new directory will be named,
and consequently what will need to be entered in the forum's URL. Keep it short and lowercase.
<li> <b> Owner Code Name:</b>
This is the code name for the forum owner. NetForum comes with a default
forum owner named "admin". If more persons will be owning forums in
your site and you want to deleagate forum managing responsibilities,
you will need to create their accounts within NetForum. To do this,
go to the main menu and click on the "Manage Forum Owners" button.

<li> <b>Owner's Web Page:</b> If this exists, the forum owner's name will always be displayed as a link to this site.
<li> <b>Forum Contact:</b> The main contact person for the forum. An email address is required.
<li> <B>Contact's Email Address:</b> The email address of the forum's contact.
<li> <b>Contact's Web Page:</b> If this exists, the forum contact's name will always be displayed as a link to this site.
<li> <b>Can anyone add topics to this forum?;</b> If no, then the user will be required a username and password before 
posting each new topic.
<li> <b>Forum Description:</b> This description will be displayed when a user enters the forum. You may leave this blank.
<li> <b>Forum Guidelines:</b> Guidelines specific to the forum; Delete the default text if this doesn't apply.
<li> <b>Forum group:</b> This is a way of defining a group of individuals who's names and email addresses will always be
accessible from Netforum. Enter one email address or name per line, alternating name/email address. If an individual has
no email address, leave a blank line below their name. Delete the default text, or leave it as is, if this doesn't apply.
</ul>
<p>
After entering the data, you may preview and edit the forum information as many times as you like before posting.<p>

Once you click on "Post Forum", this is what happens:
<ul>
<li> A directory named whatever you entered in the <b>"Code name to be appended to URL"</b> field
is created in the netforum cgi directory.
<li> In this directory, two empty directories are created: <b>topics</b> and <b>responses</b>
<li> In the forum directory, a file called "a" is created and made executable.
<li> If you gave a forum description, a file called "description" is created in the forum directory.
<li> If you gave forum guidelines, a file called "guidelines" is created in the forum directory.
<li> If you defined a forum group, a file called "group" is created in the forum directory.
</ul>
Your browser is then redirected to the new forum.<hr>
Go on to <A HREF="editforum.html">editing forum</A>.
