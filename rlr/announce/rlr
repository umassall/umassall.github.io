ANNOUNCING: Reinforcement Learning Repository
   October 10, 1997

****************************************************************************
     REINFORCEMENT LEARNING REPOSITORY AT MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY
****************************************************************************

    The Autonomous Agents Laboratory at Michigan State University Computer
Science Department is pleased to announce that a comprehensive repository
on reinforcement learning is now available on the World Wide Web.  The
home page is located at:

        	http://www.cps.msu.edu/rlr

     The goal of this repository is to promote research in reinforcement 
learning, and to facilitate the dissemination of research results in this 
area.  It currently includes the following information and links:

** Survey articles and tutorials on reinforcement learning.

** Publications on twelve areas of reinforcement learning:
      Applications to robotics, Average-reward/Undiscounted methods,
      Dynamic programming/Markov decision processes, Function
      approximation, Hierarchical methods, Industrial applications,
      Neuro-biological reinforcement learning, Partially-observable
      problems, Planning, Shaping, TD-learning, Theoretical analysis
	
    * You may auto-submit your research publication via a web-based form.

** Directory of researchers in reinforcement learning, with their e-mail
   addresses and link to their home page.

   * You may auto-submit your personal information as a reinforcement
     learning researcher via a web-based form.

** Sample domains in reinforcement learning.  Software is available to be
   downloaded; reinforcement learning algorithms implemented include
   Q-learning and SMART, an average-reward method.

** Web-based electronic discussion forums on topics in reinforcement
   learning.

   The Autonomous Agent Laboratory encourages you to visit the
Reinforcement Learning Repository, and give us feedback on how this site
can further promote research in the area of reinforcement learning.
