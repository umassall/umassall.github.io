If set to <code>on</code>, the <code>dns</code> option indicates
that wusage should attempt to look up the host names
of sites for which the access log contains
only IP addresses. <strong>Note: </strong>
the DNS option is not functional in the
MSDOS version of wusage. It <em>is</em>
functional in the OS/2 and Win 95 / Win NT versions
as well as all Unix versions.
<p>
<strong>This is important:</strong> if your log
already contains full host names for most
sites, the <code>dns</code> option is
<strong>not recommended</strong>. It is not
likely that wusage will succeed in looking
up the names of sites that your web server
could not determine for itself, and a great
deal of time will be wasted in the attempt.
<p>
<strong>If your log does not contain host names,</strong>
then you may wish to turn on the <code>dns</code>
option. Be aware that DNS (Domain Name Service)
resolution is a slow operation which requires
your computer to contact many other machines
on the Internet. <strong>For faster results, set
dns to <code>fast</code>.</strong> This will give you full
host names in your reports. However, it does not
provide enough information for the domains report or the ignoresites option
to work properly. If you wish to use those features and
your log does not already contain host names, you
will need to set DNS to <code>on</code>. If you set
the dns option to <code>on</code>,
you will want to set up wusage to
run automatically once a night, or once a week, 
using Unix <a href="automatic.html">cron</a> 
or the Windows NT <a href="automatic.html">at</a> command.
Wusage is a fast program, but DNS is a slow
operation, and it holds up the program
considerably. See also the

option, useful within company Intranets.
