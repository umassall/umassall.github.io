<h2>If You Have Problems</h2>
</a>
First, be sure you have read this manual thoroughly,
especially the <a href="requirements.html">requirements</a>
and <a href="configuring.html">configuration</a> sections.
Also read the following notes regarding common
problems users experience when running wusage.

<h3>DNS Doesn't Work</h3>
Some users have difficulty with the <a href="dns.html">dns</a>
option under Windows 95 or Windows NT. This option <em>does</em> work
properly. However, there are bugs in Windows 95 and NT that can
prevent them from working under the following circumstances:
<dl>
<dt>Windows 95
<dd>There is a memory leak in the original version of Windows 95
which causes the operating system to run out of memory after enough
socket connections have been used (this includes the sockets used
for DNS lookups). 
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/common/aa2719.htm">Microsoft has 
made a fix for this problem available.</a> The fix is not included
in Windows 95 service pack 1, so be sure to install the
service pack <em>before</em> installing the fix above. <strong>Please
see Microsoft's site for details. We do not provide Windows 95
upgrade support. This information is provided purely as a supplement
to the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/">documentation available on 
Microsoft's site.</a></strong><dt>Windows NT
<dd>Windows NT versions 3 and 4 have bugs which can prevent "reverse DNS"
lookups such as those used in Wusage from working properly. 
It is our understanding that these bugs have been fixed iin
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/NTWksSupport/">
Microsoft's service pack 5 for Windows NT 3.5 and in 
Microsoft's service pack 2 for Windows NT 4.0.</a> (Newer 
service packs, if you see them on Microsoft's site, should also 
take care of the problem.) See 
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/NTWksSupport/">Microsoft's site</a> 
for details.

<h3>Running Out of Memory</h3>
Wusage contains no arbitrary limitations on the
maximum size of a log file to be processed. However,
If your log is especially large, and especially you are using
the <code>summary</code> or <code>weekly</code> setting for the
<code><a href="frequency.html">frequency</a></code> option,
you may receive the following message:
<p>
<code>Out of Memory! wusage cannot continue without additional memory
 or swap space.</code>
<p>
This occurs when your computer does not have, or
will not allocate, enough memory for wusage to
successfully analyze your log.
<p>
Consider the following remedies:
<dl>
<dt>Use <code>monthly</code> instead of <code>summary</code>
<dd>If you receive the above message while running a
summary report, try setting the <code><a href="frequency.html">
frequency</a></code> option to <code>weekly</code> instead.
This reduces the scope of each individual report
generated by wusage and so requires less memory.
<dt>Use <code>weekly</code> instead of <code>monthly</code>
<dd>If you receive the above message while running a
monthly report, try setting the <code><a href="frequency.html">
frequency</a></code> option to <code>weekly</code> instead.
This reduces the scope of each individual report
generated by wusage and so requires less memory.
<dt>Use <code>daily</code> instead of <code>weekly</code>
<dd>If you receive the above message while running a
weekly report, try setting the <code><a href="frequency.html">
frequency</a></code> option to <code>daily</code> instead.
This reduces the scope of each individual report
generated by wusage and so requires less memory.
<dt>Add more virtual memory (swap space)
<dd>Most operating systems allow you to allocate
additional virtual memory, sometimes called
swap space or a swap file. Since virtual memory
is simulated on disk, it is economical. In most
cases, adding virtual memory is sufficient 
to allow wusage to run.
<dt>Run fewer programs at once
<dd>If you are running many other programs, insufficient
physical and virtual memory may be available to process
a large log. Try running wusage <a href="automatic.html">late at night</a>
when
few or no other programs are running.
<dt>Add more physical memory (RAM)
<dd>If all else fails, adding more physical memory
is a good solution and will typically improve the
performance of your system. Make sure that you have
not already reached limitations of your operating system
that prevent you from taking advantage of additional memory,
which can happen under MSDOS (but very rarely
under OS/2, Windows 95 or Windows NT).

<h3>"I ran wusage on an old log file, and now I have
zero accesses for the last two months! What happened?"</h3>
<p>
Wusage normally creates reports through the most recent
complete day or week, and will not generate those reports
again. You can override this behavior using the
<a href="coptions.html">-b and -e command line options</a>,
which are used to force wusage to start re-generating
reports at an earlier date, or to stop well before
the present date. If you inadvertently produce 
empty reports for the most recent several weeks or
months, just use the -b option to specify a date
from which wusage should start re-generating those reports,
and specify the more recent logfile as well using
the -l option.
