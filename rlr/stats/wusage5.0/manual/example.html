<h2>What does the output look like?</h2>
</a>
As an example, consider this set of reports covering
<a href="example/index.html">five weeks on our server</a>. This particular
set of reports was set up to analyze accesses to a newly-released
online game. Scroll down a bit on the index page to see a bar chart
comparing several different categories of accesses. Then move to the
weekly reports for 1997. Notice the referrer and user agent reports, 
as well as the trails report. GIFs and JPEGs were hidden from the
popular-documents list; accesses unrelated to the game were
ignored. Wusage has options to perform those tasks and many others. 
<p>
This particular configuration was set to produce weekly reports.
We chose this configuration to produce a reasonably compact set
of example files. Wusage can also be set up for daily and monthly reports, 
and summary reports. This is just one example of the possibilities.
