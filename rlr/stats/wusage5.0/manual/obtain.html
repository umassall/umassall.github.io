<h2>How can I obtain wusage?</h2>
</a>
You can obtain an evaluation copy of wusage from
Boutell.Com, Inc., by accessing the following URL:
<p>
<code>
<a
href="http://www.boutell.com/wusage/download.html">http://www.boutell.com/wusage/download.html</a>
</code>
<p>
<strong>We recommend that you access the above page to get the
latest information about downloading wusage.</strong>
<p>
If you cannot access external http sites, just open an 
anonymous FTP session to:
<p>
<a href="ftp://ftp.boutell.com/pub/boutell/wusage/">ftp.boutell.com, 
directory: pub/boutell/wusage/</a>
<p>
If a copy for your operating system is not available,
feel free to <a href="http://www.boutell.com/wusage/contact.html">
contact us</a> with information about your specific needs. 
(If the above link does not work for you, send
email to <a href="mailto:wusage@boutell.com">wusage@boutell.com</a>
instead.)
<p>
After you download your evaluation copy and save it to disk,
you will need to take the following steps to unpack it.
<h3>Unpacking wusage under Unix</h3>
<strong>Note that the filename of the archive you download
may differ slightly to match your operating system's name:</strong>
<p>
<pre>
gunzip wusage5.0.osname.tar.gz
tar -xf wusage5.0.osname.tar
</pre>
Note: <strong>version 4.1 was compressed using the Unix
compress utility, not with gzip.</strong> Use <code>uncompress</code>
rather than <code>gunzip</code> if you are working with an older
platform for which version 5.0 is not yet available.

wusage</a>.
<h3>Unpacking wusage under MS-DOS, OS/2, Windows 95, and Windows NT</h3>
<p>
Using the popular pkunzip .zip file extraction program,
cd to the directory where you plan to install wusage and
type the following command at the DOS, OS/2, or Windows 95/NT console prompt:
<p>
<pre>
pkunzip /d wusage41.zip
</pre>
Or use a user-friendly unzip program such as
<a href="http://www.winzip.com/">winzip</a>, a product
of Nico Mak Computing which we cheerfully recommend.

Your evaluation copy will work for 30 days, after which
it will expire. See <a href="register2.html">
How do I register wusage (how
much does it cost)?</a>
for information about acquiring a registered version.
