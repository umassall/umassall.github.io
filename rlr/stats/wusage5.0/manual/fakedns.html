The <code>fakedns</code> option, which extends for
several lines and must end with the line
<code>end fakedns</code>, is used to provide
domain name information for sites which do not
have proper host names. This is most useful in
a company Intranet, where true DNS may not be
in use, but the administrator knows that
a particular class C network is used by
a particular department. Alternatively,
many individual IP addresses for individual
machines can be listed. Accesses from sites which match 
any of the patterns listed for the <code>fakedns</code> option will be
considered to come from the domain name
given after the pattern (see the example above). 
Each character of the IP address is matched against the pattern.
An <code>*</code> in the pattern matches any
number of characters in the IP address.
Patterns have additional features; for more information about 
patterns, see the <code><a href="patterns.html">patterns</a></code>
section. 
If the <code>fakedns ... end fakedns</code>
option is absent, IP addresses will be regarded
as part of the domain <code>Other</code>.
