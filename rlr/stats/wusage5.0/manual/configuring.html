<h2>Configuring Wusage 5.0</h2>

Wusage 5.0 supports a wide range of options. We have chosen
a simple, understandable format for configuration files
in order to make wusage as easy to set up as possible.
<p>
Every server analyzed by wusage will need a unique configuration 
file. Some sites may wish to use more than one in order to study
different sections of a web site in great detail.
<p>
A configuration file contains crucial information such as
the name of the directory in which reports should be
generated and the name of the file which contains the
access log to be analyzed. A configuration file also
indicates which documents, sites and domains are of
interest to you, and which should be ignored. Last
but not least, a configuration file describes 
the look and feel of your reports.

<h3>Creating a Configuration File with makeconf</h3>

You can get started with a basic configuration file
by running the program <code>makeconf</code> (included
in the wusage package). <code>makeconf</code> will
ask you a series of questions, including the name 
of your access log directory and the name of the directory
in which reports should be generated. <code>makeconf</code>
will then produce a valid configuration file, which you
can use immediately or edit further with the
text editor of your choice.
<p>
To run <code>makeconf</code>, just <code>cd</code>
to the directory where you untarred or unzipped wusage 5.0,
and type <code>makeconf</code> (under DOS, OS/2, Windows 95
and Windows NT) or <code>./makeconf</code> (under Unix) to start the program. 
<p>
<strong>Important Windows, Windows 95 and Windows NT note:</strong>
<p>
Run makeconf and wusage from the DOS (or NT) console prompt, not by 
double-clicking on the program in file manager or on the desktop. You 
will have an easier time reading the output of the program if it does 
not immediately disappear after running. <strong>Do not have to shut down
Windows to get to the DOS prompt;</strong> just select MSDOS in
the main program group, or from the start menu in Windows 95. 
<p>
<em>"Does that mean makeconf is a DOS application?"</em>
<p>
No, makeconf is an "NT console application." This means that, although
it has a character-based user interface, it has access to the full
32-bit power and resources of the windows 95/NT platform and is
not subject to the normal resource limitations of DOS applications.
<p>
<strong>Important OS/2 note:</strong>
If you are using OS/2, run the programs from the OS/2 prompt, not 
from the DOS compatibility box prompt. Otherwise, the program
will run in the less powerful MSDOS compatibility mode with
short file names only.
<p>
(<strong>Important Unix note:</strong> Unix users may need to type
<code>./makeconf</code> to be sure that the program
is found. If you get error messages when typing
<code>makeconf</code>, the shell is probably finding
a different program by that name. Type <code>./makeconf</code>
to avoid any conflict.
<h4>Working with makeconf</h4>
You will be prompted for all the necessary information.
When <code>makeconf</code> displays text in
brackets, that text is the default for the question
you are being asked. In some cases, the default is
just an example. These cases are clearly marked; for instance,
you must type in the location of your server access log files
in order to analyze them. Most of the time, however, you can press 
enter to accept the default and all will go well.
<p>
If you do not have the information you need to answer
a question, just press control-C to exit the program,
find the information you need and run <code>makeconf</code>
again. Depending on your system, you may be able to
find the information in another window without
stopping the <code>makeconf</code> program.
<p>
<h4>Other Configuration Options</h4>
Wusage has <strong>many other useful configuration options not
covered by makeconf</strong>, which aims for simplicity. Be sure
to check out the <a href="reference.html">configuration
file reference guide</a> to learn about additional options.
<h4>Moving On</h4>
Once you have finished working with <code>makeconf</code>,
you are ready to move on to <a href="running.html">
running wusage</a>. 

<a name="upgrade">
<h3>Upgrading from Version 3.2</h3>
</a>

<blockquote>
If you are currently using <strong>Wusage 3.2</strong>, you will want to read
this section. <strong>If you are upgrading from Wusage 4.0 or 4.1, you
don't need to take any special steps.</strong> Just check out the
<a href="whatsnew.html">What's New</a> section to find out about
new options you may wish to turn on in your configuration file.
</blockquote>

Wusage 4.0 and up have a new, much improved and much friendlier
format for configuration files. To use old version 3.2
configuration files, you will need to run the program
<code>upgrade</code> (included in the wusage package).
If you are not interested in converting old configuration
files, skip ahead to the <a href="running.html">running wusage</a>
section.
<p>
<strong>Example:</strong><p>
<code>upgrade oldusage.conf</code> (or .con under DOS)
<p>
(<strong>Important Unix note:</strong> Unix users may need to type
<code>./upgrade</code>, not just upgrade, to be sure that the program
is found.)
<p>
<code>upgrade</code> will convert your configuration
file to the new format and save a backup copy of the
original.

<h4>Taking Advantage of New Features</h4>
Keep in mind that version 5.0 includes many new
configuration file options. Don't miss out; check
out the <a href="reference.html">configuration file
reference</a> and the <a href="whatsnew.html">what's new</a>
section. If you are using domain pie charts,
you will also want to consider copying the
new list of continents and national domains
from the <code>sample.conf</code> (or sample.con) file.
If you wish, paste the <code>domaingroups</code> section of 
that file into your upgraded configuration file,
and delete the outdated list.
<h4>Converting wusage 3.2 Report Data</h4>

After converting the configuration file, <code>upgrade</code>
will ask whether you want to convert your old report
data as well. 
<p>
<blockquote>
Do you have all of your old access log data, perhaps in
compressed form? If so, you may wish to skip this step
and run wusage 5.0 once on <a href="manylogs.html">all of your old
logs</a>
at once to produce new reports. Version 5.0 produces more complete and 
attractive information than version 3.2.
</blockquote>
<p>
If you decide to convert your data, keep four things in mind:

<dl>
<dt><strong>Keep a backup copy.</strong>
<dd>Make a backup copy of your usage directory
if you want to run wusage 3.2 (the old version) again
at some time in the future.

<dt><strong>Old reports will be available, but not rewritten.</strong>
<dd>Wusage will rename the report files and create
a database for use with wusage 5.0. However, it will
not rewrite the reports themselves, so <strong>you will not
see a dramatic change in the old reports.</strong> Reports
for new weeks <strong>will</strong> take advantage of the
new features of wusage 5.0.  

<dt><strong>You must run wusage 5.0 after running upgrade.</strong>
<dd>After you run <code>upgrade</code>, be sure to <a href="running.html">
run <code>wusage</code></a> with your upgraded configuration file
in order to create a new index page.

<dt><strong>wusage 3.2 recorded overall totals only.</strong>
<dd>Once you have run both <code>upgrade</code> and
<code>wusage</code>, the chart of total accesses over time
will be available in the HTML page index.html or index.htm in the report
directory. However, you will note that the chart of "Home Page Accesses" 
is blank. This is normal. This occurs because version 3.2 did not 
record that information. Once you have run wusage 5.0 for
a few new weeks, you will begin to see useful data in
this chart. Note that you can add additional charts
in the <code>totals</code> section of the
configuration file.
