If present, the <code>visits</code> option indicates
that wusage should output information about
individual visits to the server. Wusage estimates the duration 
of a visit by examining the amount of time between document 
requests from the same site. Although this method is
not perfect, these estimates are normally quite accurate and useful.
<p>
When the <code>visits</code> option is turned on,
wusage generates a list of "example" visits to the
server. These visits are of a variety of durations
and represent a cross-section of user activity on
your server. You can control the number of example
visits in the report using the 
<a href="examplevisits.html">examplevisits</a> option.
<p>
Visits of at least a certain length are considered
to be <em>trails,</em> and considered for inclusion
in the <a href="trail.html">trails report</a> depending
on their popularity.
<p>
The <code>visits</code> option defaults to <code>on</code>.
