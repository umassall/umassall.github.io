The <code>nopartial</code> option, when it is present,
instructs wusage <em>not</em> to generate a report
for the current day, week or month in progress. By default,
Wusage 5.0 does generate such a report and include it
in the index, although it is not included in the
historical graphs since the data is incomplete.
If you typically have almost no data for the new
day, week or month in your log when you run wusage,
you may wish to use the <code>nopartial</code> option
to turn off these "incomplete" reports.
