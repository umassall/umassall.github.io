<strong>This option is only useful if your server logs
contain referrer information as an extra field, optionally
in quotes, after the regular common log format fields, or if you have
a separate referrer log. See the <a href="server.html">server notes</a>
section for information on configuring popular web servers to
log this information in the best possible way. If you have a separate
referrer log, use the <code><a href="coptions.html">-r</a></code>
command line option and the <code><a href="coptions.html">-l filename</a></code>
command line option when starting wusage. This produces a special
summary report called <code>referrers.html</code> (note the spelling)
in the report directory. It is best to configure your server to log the 
information in the main log file so it can be included in regular reports. 
If your log does not contain referrer data, this report will not
contain useful information!</strong>
<p>
If present, the <code>referrers</code> option indicates
that wusage should output information about the
"referring" URLs that <strong>linked to</strong> pages on your server.
the server. <strong>Note that browsers do not always report the
referring URL.</strong> If the <code>referrers</code> option 
is absent, or set to <code>off</code>, a referrers report will
not be generated. If it is set to <code>nopie</code>,
the report is generated, but a pie chart is not drawn.
This option is useful to determine what outside sites
contain references to your site.
<strong>You may receive unexpected
results if your logs do not contain referrer information.</strong>
<p>
You will probably want to use the 
<code><a href="ignorereferrers.html">ignorereferrers</a></code> option to 
ignore referring URLs that are within your own site. This ensures that
outside links stand out in the referrers report. If you use the
<code>makeconf</code> utility to configure wusage, this will be 
set up for you.
