<h3>Command Line Options</h3>
</a>
The wusage program supports the following command
line options:
<dl>
<dt><code>-c config_file_name</code>
<dd>The -c option should be followed by the name of the
configuration file (typically wusage.conf or wusage.con under DOS). This
is
the only <strong>required</strong> command line option.
<dt><code>-u</code> (always used with <code>-l</code>)
<dd>The -u option is used to specify that wusage should
analyze a stand-alone <strong>user agent log</strong>.
This option is always used in conjunction with the
<code>-l filename</code> option, which indicates where
the user agent log file is located. <strong>This option produces
a report called <code>agents.html</code></strong> in the
report directory. This special filename is used to avoid
overwriting the normal output of wusage. <strong>It is better
to <a href="server.html">configure your web server</a> to
log this information in the regular server log</strong> so it
can be analyzed as part of your normal reports. 
<dt><code>-r</code> (always used with <code>-l</code>)
<dd>The -r option is used to specify that wusage should
analyze a stand-alone <strong>referrer log</strong>.
This option is always used in conjunction with the
<code>-l filename</code> option, which indicates where
the referrer log file is located. <strong>This option produces
a report called <code>referrers.html</code></strong> (note
the spelling) in the report directory. This special filename is used 
to avoid overwriting the normal output of wusage. <strong>It is better
to <a href="server.html">configure your web server</a> to
log this information in the regular server log</strong> so it
can be analyzed as part of your normal reports. 

<dt><code>-b MM/DD or MM/DD/YY or MM/DD/YYYY</code>
<dd>The -b option is used to specify the date from
which wusage should begin producing reports. If the
-b option is not specified, wusage generates reports
beginning with the day or week immediately following
the last day or week generated on a previous run,
or from the first date in the log file if wusage
has not been run before. If the -b option is specified, 
wusage will produce reports <strong>from that date 
forward</strong> to the present day, or another ending date 
specified by the -e option. Three date formats are supported:
MM/DD (example: 9/29), MM/DD/YY (example: 9/29/1980),
and MM/DD/YYYY (example: 9/29/1980). This option
is useful if you have accidentally run wusage on
a partial log file and wish to run it again to
re-generate the reports for the missing days using
data in another log file.
<dt><code>-e MM/DD or MM/DD/YY or MM/DD/YYYY</code>
<dd>The -e option is used to specify the date on 
which wusage should stop producing reports. If
the -e option is specified, wusage will produce
reports <strong>up to and including that date</strong>.
Otherwise, wusage will produce reports through the
most recent complete day or week. Three date formats are 
supported: MM/DD (example: 9/29), MM/DD/YY (example: 9/29/1980),
and MM/DD/YYYY (example: 9/29/1980). This option
is useful if you wish to run wusage on only a
certain time period found in a large log file,
especially if you are generating a summary report.
<dt><code>-s</code>
<dd>The -s option specifies that wusage should
generate a summary report. This option
overrides the <code><a href="frequency.html">frequency</a></code>
configuration file option.
<dt><code>-v</code>
<dd>The -v option displays the version number
of wusage.
<dt><code>-l log_file_or_directory or -</code>
<dd>The -l option is used to override the 
<code><a href="logfile.html">logfile</a></code> or <code><a
href="logdir.html">logdir</a></code>
configuration
file option. If the -l option is given, the specified
log file or directory of log files will be analyzed instead. If the
special
log file name <code>-</code> (a single dash) is given,
wusage will expect to read its input from 
standard input. This is particularly useful
when working with <a href="manylogs.html">pipelines</a>
of several commands such as the Unix cat and
zcat commands.
</dl>
<strong>Note: </strong> because wusage has so
many useful options, it is primarily
controlled by <a href="reference.html">
configuration file options</a> rather than
command line options.
