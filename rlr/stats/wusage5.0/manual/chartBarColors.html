<p>
The <code>chartBarColors</code> option is used to specify
the list of colors that will be used for each bar (or line)
in the bar charts generated by Wusage. The first color is used
for the first item in any bar chart, the second color for the
second item (when using the 
<a href="totalsgroup.html"><code>totalsgroup</code></a>
option), and so on. Wusage reuses colors when it reaches
the end of the list.
<p>
You may specify as many colors as you want. Due to space
limitations, Wusage will only display up to eight items
in the "3D bar chart" style, but more than eight colors
are still useful to distinguish among the different lines
drawn in the "2D line chart" style. Wusage switches to the
2D line chart style when there are more than 75 data points
across or more than eight (8) items being graphed.
<p>
Colors should be specified in the standard format used to
specify all colors in HTML pages:
<pre>
RRGGBB
</pre>
<strong>VERY IMPORTANT: do <strong>NOT</strong> place a # in front
of the color, even though HTML would allow this, because this will cause 
Wusage to ignore that line as a comment. We apologize for this
potential source of confusion.</strong>
<p>
<strong>Don't panic.</strong> there are plenty of pages on the
web that provide lists of colors in this format, because it is
<strong>also used in HTML pages.</strong>
