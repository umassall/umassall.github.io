<h2>Wusage and local Internets (Intranets)</h2>
Many webmasters working within localized Internets
of a particular organization, increasingly known
as Intranets, have expressed a desire to be able
to chart accesses from lower-level domains within
the company, rather than exclusively from
top-level domains. For example, if a server is accessed only
from sites within the <code>hubrisoft.com</code>
domain, it doesn't make sense to chart 
<code>edu</code> accesses versus <code>com</code>
accesses.
<p>
Wusage accommodates this wish. The
<code><a href="subdomainsof.html">subdomainsof</a></code> option
can be used to list all subdomains of the specified
domain as top-level domains in the domains report.
<p>
You'll want to remove the <code><a
href="domaingroups.html">domaingroups</a>
</code> option or provide groups of your own if your
Internet is strictly internal.
<p>
<h3>"What if I don't have host names for all of
my machines?"</h3>
<p>
Do some of your internal machines only have IP addresses,
not host names? Not a problem. You can use the
<code><a href="fakedns.html">fakedns</a></code> option to
add domain names (not site names) for particular IP addresses, and you 
can use a pattern to assign all of the IP addresses
in a particular class C subnet the same domain name.
