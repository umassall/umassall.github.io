<strong>This option is only useful if your server logs
contain user agent information as a quoted field after
the regular common log format fields, or if you have
a separate user agent log. See the <a href="server.html">server notes</a>
section for information on configuring popular web servers to
log this information in the best possible way. If you have a separate
user agent log, use the <code><a href="coptions.html">-u</a></code>
command line option and the <code><a href="coptions.html">-l filename</a></code>
command line option when starting wusage. This produces a special
summary report called <code>agents.html</code> in the report
directory. It is best to configure your server to log the information in 
the main log file so it can be included in regular reports. If your log does 
not contain user agent data, this report will not
contain useful information!</strong>
<p>
If present, the <code>useragents</code> option indicates
that wusage should output information about the
user agents (web browsers) that were used to access
the server. <strong>Note that browsers do not always identify
themselves.</strong> If the <code>useragents</code> option 
is absent, or set to <code>off</code>, a useragents report will
not be generated. If it is set to <code>nopie</code>,
the report is generated, but a pie chart is not drawn.
This option is useful to determine what web browsers
were used to access the site. <strong>You may receive unexpected
results if your logs do not contain user agent information.</strong>
