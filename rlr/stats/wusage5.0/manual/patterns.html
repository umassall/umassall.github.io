<h2>Patterns: Matching Documents and Sites</h2>
</a>
Many of the configuration file options, such
as <code><a href="allow.html">allow</a></code>
and <code><a href="totals.html">totals</a></code>,
allow the use of patterns. Patterns are used
to match several, many or all documents or sites
with a single line in the configuration file.
<p>
The simplest pattern is a document name
(or site name). For instance:
<p>
<code>/directory/name.html</code>
<p>
This pattern matches only the single
document <code>/directory/name.html</code>.
If it is listed for the <code><a href="ignore.html">ignore</a></code>
option, then that document will be ignored
in all statistics produced by wusage.
<p>
A slightly more complex pattern uses an
<code>*</code> character to match any
number of characters. This is identical
to the way both MSDOS and Unix use the <code>*</code>
character for commands such as Unix <code>ls</code>
and MSDOS <code>dir</code>. For instance:
<p>
<code>*.gif</code>
<p>
This pattern matches all document names
which end in the letters <code>.gif</code>.
This is useful in the <code><a href="ignore.html">ignore</a></code>
option, where it instructs wusage to completely
ignore all accesses to GIF-format images. 
<p>
<strong>Note:</strong> the <code><a href="suffixes.html">
suffixes</a></code> option is applied
<strong>first,</strong> before options
such as <code><a href="allow.html">allow</a></code>
and <code><a href="ignore.html">ignore</a></code>. If you want
to write a pattern that matches a document such
as <code>/index.html</code>, take into account
that the <code>index.html</code> part will be
removed by the standard suffixes option and
use the <code>/</code> by itself. For the
index file of a subdirectory, the slash will
also be removed to combine all accesses to
that index into one document name.
<p>
The <code>*</code> character can appear more
than once, and it can appear at any point
in the pattern. (This is slightly different
from the way MSDOS uses the <code>*</code>.)
<p>
The <code>?</code> character can also be used.
<code>?</code> matches any <em>one</em> character
in the document name or site name. 
<p>
Finally, the <code>|</code> character can be
used to separate distinct patterns on the same
line. If a document name or site name matches
<em>any</em> of the patterns separated
by the | character on that line, it is considered 
to be a match for the complete pattern.
