end ignorereferrers

The <code>ignorereferrers</code> option, which extends for
several lines and must end with the line
<code>end ignorereferrers</code>, indicates which referrer
URLs will be ignored by wusage for purposes of generating
the <a href="referrers.html">referrers report</a>. Referring
URLs which match any of the patterns listed
for the <code>ignorereferrers</code> option will be
ignored only for purposes of the referrers report; they are
included normally in other reports. Each character
of the referring URL is matched against the pattern.
An <code>*</code> in the pattern matches any
number of characters in the referring URL.
Patterns have additional features; for more information about 
patterns, see the <code><a href="patterns.html">patterns</a></code>
section. If the <code>ignorereferrers ... end ignorereferrers</code>
option is absent, no sites will be ignored.
