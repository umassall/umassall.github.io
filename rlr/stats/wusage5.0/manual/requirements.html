<h2>What else do I need to run wusage?</h2>
</a>
If you have one of the supported versions of Unix,
MS-DOS, IBM OS/2, or Microsoft Windows, Windows 95 or NT, 
all you need is a web server which produces an access log file 
in one of three standard log file formats. These formats are known
as the "common" log file format (most servers output this),
the EMWAC log file format (some versions of the EMWAC server
for Windows NT output this), and the Microsoft IIS log file
format. Wusage 5.0 recognizes certain variations on the common
log format, including at least one variation produced by the
Oracle web server. Additional fields <strong>after</strong> the
regular "common log format" fields are also acceptable, and
Wusage can analyze these if they are formatted properly; see
the <a href="server.html">server configuration tips</a> section
for more information.
Wusage will also support other formats if there is a demand for them.
Feel free to <a href="http://www.boutell.com/wusage/contact.html">
contact us</a> if you have a need for other formats.

instead.)

Here is an excerpt from a log file in the common
log file format:

</pre>
Here is an excerpt from a log file in an extended form of the
common log file format, with referring URL and user agent fields
added in the <a href="server.html">recommended way:</a>
<pre>
