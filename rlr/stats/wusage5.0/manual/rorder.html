<h4>Controlling the Order of Reports</h4>
Wusage 5.0, unlike previous versions, outputs reports <strong>in the order 
they are turned on in your log file</strong>. Reports that are not explicitly 
turned on, but which are turned on by default, appear at the top or 
bottom of the report. If you do not turn on these reports explicitly,
they appear in the following order. All other reports are turned
off unless you explicitly turn them on.
