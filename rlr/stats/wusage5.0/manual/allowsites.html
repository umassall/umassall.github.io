allowsites
#A pattern matching anything (this is the default)

#A pattern matching only sites in the boutell.com domain,
#including boutell.com itself
*boutell.com
end allowsites
</pre>
The <code>allowsites</code> option, which extends for
several lines and must end with the line
<code>end allowsites</code>, indicates which sites
will be considered by wusage. Accesses from sites that
do not match any of the patterns listed
for the <code>allowsites</code> option will be
ignored completely by wusage. Each character
of the site name is matched against the pattern.
An <code>*</code> in the pattern matches any
number of characters in the site name.
Patterns have additional features; for more information about 
patterns, see the <code><a href="patterns.html">patterns</a></code>
section. If the <code>allowsites ... end allowsites</code>
option is absent, accesses from all sites will be considered.
