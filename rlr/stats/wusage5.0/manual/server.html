<h2>Server Configuration Tips</h2>

If you need to know how to configure your web server to produce
user agent and/or referrer log information, 
this section will be of interest to you.
<p>
<h4>Tips for the Apache server</h4>
<dd>The free Apache web server, which we highly recommend 
for use on Unix platforms, can be easily configured to produce
user agent and referrer logs. You may have already configured
your server to log this information in separate log files,
and Wusage can analyze these; see the <a href="coptions.html">-u
and -r command line options.</a> 
<p>
However, this is not the best way. <em>When your referrer and
user agent logs are separate, Wusage cannot display these
reports as part of your normal daily, weekly or monthly
usage reports.</em> We recommend that you take the following steps:
<p>
1. Make sure the mod_log_config Apache "module" is compiled into
your server. See the <a href="http://www.apache.org/">Apache documentation</a>
for details. 
<p>
2. Add the following line to your <code>httpd.conf</code>
file in the Apache <code>conf</code> directory:
<pre>
LogFormat "%h %l %u %t \"%r\" %s %b \"%{Referer}i\" \"%{User-agent}i\""
</pre> 
(note that referrer must be spelled with only two r's when
configuring Apache. For Wusage we chose to go with the spelling 
in the dictionary.)
<p>
3. When you have done both of these things, restart
the Apache server on the fly using the <code>kill&nbsp;-1</code>
Unix command.
<p>
The Apache server will now log in the usual "common log format,"
<strong>with the addition of two new fields,</strong> referrer
and user agent.
<h4>For Microsoft IIS</h4>

Microsoft IIS does not have the option of logging
user agent and referrer information in its basic form.
<strong>However,</strong> a filter that adds this
capability is freely available. The filter was written by 
<strong>Marc Grossman</strong> of Microsoft, who is in no way
associated with Boutell.Com, Inc. 
<a href="http://www.genusa.com/isapi/newlogb.zip">Follow this link
to obtain the filter.</a> Instructions for installation are in the
HTML document <code>default.htm</code> which is included in the 
zip file. The filter is distributed by the
<a href="http://www.genusa.com/isapi/index.html">ISAPI developer's
site</a>, a useful service run by Steven Genusa. We are not associated
with the ISAPI developer's site in any way. <em>We do not provide
technical support for software not written by Boutell.Com, Inc.</em>
Please see the file <code>default.htm</code> included with
the filter software for installation instructions.
<p>
Once you have the filter installed, Wusage 5.01 will recognize
the user agent and referrer fields in the resulting log files.
Be sure to turn on the <a href="referrers.html"><code>referrers</code></a> 
and <a href="useragents.html"><code>useragents</code></a> options in your 
configuration file. 
<p>
The original release of Wusage 5.0 for NT did not recognize
these new fields. <a href="http://www.boutell.com/wusage/download.html">
Version 5.01 adds this capability and can be downloaded here.</a> There is no 
charge to upgrade from 5.0 to 5.01.

<h4>For Other Servers</h4>

Most web servers can be configured to log in a variety
of different formats. For best results, configure your
web server to log in the common log format, with the
addition of the referrer and user agent fields. The
referrer field should come first, followed by the
user agent field. <strong>Both fields should be in
quotes for best results, especially the user agent field,
which can contain spaces. If the user agent field cannot
be enclosed in quotes, configure your server to place it
at the end of the line after all other fields.</strong> Wusage will 
also recognize a virtual server domain name field, if present, and 
compare this to the <a href="servername.html">servername</a> option
to determine whether a particular access is relevant.
<p>
Below is an example of the common log format, <strong>extended
to include referrer and user agent information.</strong>

<pre>
foo.bar.com - - [20/Apr/1997:16:48:44 -0700] "GET /boutell/index.html HTTP/1.0" 200 5898 "http://www.altavista.digital.com/query" "Mozilla/3.01 (Macintosh; I; PPC)"
