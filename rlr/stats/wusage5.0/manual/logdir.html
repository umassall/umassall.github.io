<code>logdir</code> indicates the directory in which
your server's log files are kept. If you specify a
directory name for this option, wusage will analyze
<strong>all</strong> standard log files found in that
directory. (Files which do not contain valid log
data will be ignored.) This option is very useful
if your server creates a new log file each day,
or if you have several log files from different
mirror sites. Note that wusage can still handle
all of your log files even if several files have
entries for the same period in time. Although more
than 20 log files that <strong>overlap in time</strong>
will slow wusage down considerably, any number of
nonoverlapping log files should not present a problem.
See your web server's documentation and configuration files
or talk to your internet service provider
for more information about the location of the
server log files. The <code>logdir</code> option can be overridden
by the <code>-l</code> command line option. See
the section on <a href="manylogs.html">reading from
many log files</a> for more information about working
with more than one log file.
