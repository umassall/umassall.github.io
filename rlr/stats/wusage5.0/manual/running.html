<h2>Running wusage</h2>
</a>

Now that you have a wusage configuration file, you are
ready to begin taking advantage of wusage. 
<p>
First, note that if you are producing daily, weekly
or monthly reports, <strong>you do not have to run
Wusage more often than once per day, week or month.</strong> 
recommended that you run wusage shortly after
midnight, on the first day of the new week or month
if you are using weekly or monthly reports.
<p>
<strong>New in version 5.0:</strong> if you want
to see <strong>information about the current day, week
or month in progress,</strong> feel free to run Wusage
more often than once per day, week or month. You will find
that a report for the time period in progress is included
in the index of reports, although this partial report
is <strong>not</strong> included in historical graphs,
in order to avoid inaccuracy.
<p>
<strong>VERY, VERY, VERY IMPORTANT:</strong> NEVER delete
your log file data until Wusage has had a chance to
produce a <strong>complete report for that time period.</strong>
If you are producing weekly reports, <strong>don't delete or
remove your log data for any part of that week until wusage
has been run on the entire week's data at once.</strong>
<p>
To execute wusage, <code>cd</code> to the directory
containing the program and enter the following command:
<pre>
wusage -c wusage.conf    (or wusage.con under DOS)
</pre>
(<strong>Important Unix note:</strong> Unix users may need to type
<code>./wusage</code>, not just wusage, to be sure that the program
is found.)

<strong>Note: </strong>here it is assumed that your
<a href="configuring.html">configuration file</a> has been
created and has the name wusage.conf (or wusage.con under DOS). 
<p>
If this is the first time you have run the program,
a welcoming message will be displayed. Under normal
circumstances, <strong>no output will be printed
on the screen by wusage.</strong> If your log file
is large, it may take some time for wusage to
complete its run, <strong>especially if the 
DNS option has been selected.</strong> If your
log already contains hostnames for most sites,
or if speed is an issue, do not select the DNS option
in your configuration file, or set the
DNS option to <code>fast</code>, which looks up
names that appear in your reports only but does
not work with the <code><a href="ignoresites.html">ignoresites</a></code>
and <code><a href="domains.html">domains</a></code> options.
<p>
<strong>Note:</strong> if your log file is empty,
wusage may indicate that no input was available.
This is normal and the message will go away when
your log file actually contains accesses. 
If you do have accesses in log file and you still
get this message, your log file may not be in
a format that Wusage supports.
