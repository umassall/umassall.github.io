#Example: compare the total accesses to these
#three subdirectories, on a single 3D bar chart
/marketing*
/sales*
/development*
end totalsgroup
</pre>
The <code>totalsgroup</code> option, which extends for
several lines and must end with the line
<code>end totalsgroup</code>, is used to declare
a special interest in certain documents
or sets of documents. Each line of the <code>totalsgroup</code>
option contains a <a href="patterns.html">pattern</a>
and a title for that pattern. Wusage will count
the total number of accesses to and bytes served
of that pattern, and in the case of daily,
weekly and monthly reports, a single bar graph comparing the
popularity of those patterns over time will be generated.
<strong>One combined bar chart is generated for all of 
the items.</strong> To present a separate bar chart for each item,
see the <a href="totals.html"><code>totals</code> option.</a> 
<p>
The three patterns shown above match all references
to each of three different directory names.
Each character of each document name 
is matched against each pattern in the
<code>totalsgroup</code> list. An <code>*</code> in a pattern 
matches any number of characters in a document name. 
Patterns have additional features; for more information,
see the <code><a href="patterns.html">patterns</a></code>
section. 
<p>
The <code>totalsgroup</code> option may appear as many times
as desired, in order to create several distinct groups,
with one bar chart appearing per group. However,
the same pattern should not appear more than once.
