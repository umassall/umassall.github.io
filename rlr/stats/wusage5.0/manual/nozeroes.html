The <code>nozeroes</code> option, when it is present,
instructs wusage not to display entries in the 
<a href="totals.html"><code>totals</code></a> or
<a href="totalsgroup.html"><code>totalsgroup</code></a> 
reports if there were zero accesses matching those
entries. This option is useful if a very large
number of entries have been configured, perhaps for
the web pages of each customer of an ISP. On the
history page, an entry is only dropped if it has
<em>always</em> been zero. On individual day, week
or month reports, the entry is dropped for that particular
report if there were no accesses for that time period.
