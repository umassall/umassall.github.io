<h2>Interpreting the reports of wusage</h2>
</a>
To see the results of running wusage, open
the <code>index.html</code> (or index.htm) file in 
the report directory with your favorite
web browser. This filename can be changed using
the <code><a href="indexname.html">indexname</a></code> 
configuration file option. If you are producing summary
reports, open the <code>summary.html</code> 
(or summary.htm) file instead.
<h4>Interpreting Daily, Weekly and Monthly History Reports</h4>
If you are producing daily, weekly or monthly reports, you should
now be seeing the "history page." This
page features graphs over time of all documents matching
the various <a href="totals.html">totals</a> that have
been specified in the configuration file. The graphs
display accesses over time, unless the
<code><a href="order.html">order</a></code> configuration
file option has been used to change the scale to
reflect bytes transmitted instead of accesses.
(NOTE: server logs in the older EMWAC format do not
contain information about the number of bytes transmitted.)
<p>
If only one day or week of data is present
in the log, the charts will not appear, as
two points are necessary to draw a line.
<p>
Beneath the graphs, links to reports for individual
months can be found, or to sublistings for the days
of a month or the weeks of a year. 
Select the report for an individual day, week or month 
now in order to follow the explanation.

<h4>Interpreting Day, Week, Month, and Summary Reports</h4>

For each time period, or for the entire log when
the the <code><a href="frequency.html">frequency</a></code>
option is set to <code>summary</code>, wusage writes
a report providing details of accesses to the
server during that time period.
<h4>Totals Report</h4>
The page begins with a table displaying total
accesses and bytes transmitted during that
period for each of the <code><a href="totals.html">totals</a></code>
specified in the configuration file. You can
configure many such totals.
(NOTE: server logs in the older EMWAC format do not
contain information about the number of bytes transmitted.)
<p>
<strong>Note:</strong> if your web browser does
not support tables, you will want to change the
<code><a href="html.html">html</a></code> option in
your configuration file to <code>2.0</code> instead
of <code>3.0</code> to produce lists instead
of tables. 
<h4>Hourly Report</h4>
Beneath the totals table is a graph indicating the
pattern of access by time of day. This graph
displays total accesses on the Y axis and the
hour of the day on the X axis. It is possible
to change this graph to display bytes transmitted
instead using the 
<code><a href="order.html">order</a></code> configuration
file option. Beneath the graph is a table,
providing accesses, bytes sent, and bits per
second and bytes per second for each hour of
the day. The last two columns are especially
useful to gauge your impact on your Internet
provider's connection to the net through the day, 
or to gauge the impact of particular documents
and sites if the <code><a href="allow.html">allow</a></code>
and/or <code><a href="allowsites.html">allowsites</a></code>
options are in use. (The last two columns are not present if 
summary reports are being generated.)
NOTE: server logs in the older EMWAC format do not
contain information about the number of bytes transmitted.
<h4>Popular Documents Report</h4>
Next in the report is a pie chart and a table
featuring the most frequently accessed documents
on your site. The pie chart displays only the documents
which were "popular" enough to occupy a visible
pie slice, and combines the rest in the 
<em>Other</em> category. The table is ranked
by total accesses, unless the <code><a href="order.html">order</a></code>
option is used to change the ranking order
to <code>bytes</code> instead. The number of
documents displayed in the table can be set
to any value, including <code>all</code>, using the 
<code><a href="top.html">top</a></code> option. 
Documents can be explicitly allowed or ignored
using the <code><a href="allow.html">allow</a></code>
and <code><a href="ignore.html">ignore</a></code> options,
which are useful to exclude potentially uninteresting 
documents such as inline images, or to allow only
the documents of one user.
<h4>The Frequent Sites Report</h4>
If the <code><a href="sites.html">sites</a></code> option
is present in your configuration file, wusage will
report on the sites most frequently accessing your
server. Beneath the documents table is a table of
the sites (Internet addresses) that accessed
your server most often. The table is ranked
by total accesses, unless the <code><a href="order.html">order</a></code>
option is used to change the ranking order
to <code>bytes</code> instead. The number of
sites displayed in the table can be set
to any value, including <code>all</code>, using the 
<code><a href="topsites.html">topsites</a></code> option. 
Sites can be explicitly allowed or ignored
using the <code><a href="allowsites.html">allowsites</a></code>
and <code><a href="ignoresites.html">ignoresites</a></code> options.
This can be handy to exclude local test accesses
or allow only accesses from your own organization.
Note that major Internet providers such as AOL may
appear as a small number of IP addresses making
a large number of accesses.
<h4>Should I turn on DNS?</h4>
Looking at the table of sites, you may note
that the sites are given only by IP
address, rather than by hostname. Below
is an example of each case:
<p>
<strong>IP Address: </strong>127.0.0.1<br>
<strong>Host Name: </strong>boutell.com
<p>
If you see only IP addresses, it is likely that
your server does not perform DNS (Domain Name
Service) resolution for each access. This is not
uncommon, because DNS can be a slow operation
which limits the speed of the web server. 
If you are interested in seeing full host
names, especially to produce meaningful
domain charts as described below, you may
with to add the <code><a href="dns.html">dns</a></code>
option in your configuration file.
<p>
If you see a <strong>mixture of IP addresses
and host names,</strong> you probably do 
<strong>not</strong> need to turn on DNS.
It is normal for many addresses (perhaps 30% to 50%)
to lack proper host names, and asking wusage to make a 
second attempt to look them up will only slow down
the program.
<h4>The Domains Report</h4>
If both the <code><a href="sites.html">sites</a></code> option
and the <code><a href="domains.html">domains</a></code> option are 
present in your configuration file, wusage will
report on the Internet domains most frequently accessing your
server. Internet top-level domains are political and
economic classifications such as <code>com</code>
(commercial, often US), <code>edu</code> (educational,
often US), and <code>ru</code> (Russia). 
<p>
Wusage features the ability to <strong>combine several
domains by continent or another criteria of your
choice.</strong> This allows wusage to generate a
meaningful pie chart which breaks down accesses by
continent. 
<p>
You can control the way domains are combined using
the <code><a href="domaingroups.html">domaingroups</a></code>
option. You can also specify how many domains are
included in the chart using the <code><a href="topdomains.html">
topdomains</a></code> option, which is often unnecessary
due to the set of domain groups for continents
included in the configuration files created by
<code>makeconf</code>. You can also obtain this
list by copying the <code>domaingroups</code> option
from the sample.conf file (sample.con under DOS) to your own
configuration file.
<h4>The Result Codes Report</h4>
Next to last in the report is a summary of the
number of accesses to your server which resulted
in each HTTP result code. The result code
200 ("Ok") is usually the most common. Result
codes such as 301 ("Moved Permanently") are not
uncommon especially if your site uses imagemaps
and other forms of redirection. The result code
404 ("Not Found") sometimes means that users are
still trying to access a document that has been
removed, and solving such problems is the purpose
of the last section of the report.

<h4>The Documents Not Found Report</h4>

If you have specified the <a
href="notfound.html"><code>notfound</code></a>
option in your configuration file, then your reports will
end with a list of the URLs that users unsuccessfully
tried to retrieve from your server. Sometimes this is
due to simple keyboarding error, or to outdated links
from other sites. At other times, you may realize that
you have accidentally removed or renamed a file, which
is a good reason to turn on this option.
<h4>Other Reports</h4>
If you are operating a proxy server, specify the 
<a href="proxysites.html"><code>proxysites</code></a> option in
your configuration file to get statistics on the sites
being accessed through the proxy server. If you are
using HTTP basic authentication or another standard
method of password-protecting some of your documents
and directories, you will be interested in the
<a href="authusers.html"><code>authusers</code></a> option,
which produces statistics on the users who logged
in to a password-protected portion of your site.
<p>
This concludes a brief tour of the reports 
typically generated by wusage. Many additional configuration
options are available, and we invite you to examine
the <a href="reference.html">configuration file reference</a>.
