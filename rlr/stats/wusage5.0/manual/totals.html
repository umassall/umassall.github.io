The <code>totals</code> option, which extends for
several lines and must end with the line
<code>end totals</code>, is used to declare
a special interest in certain documents
or sets of documents. Each line of the <code>totals</code>
option contains a <a href="patterns.html">pattern</a>
and a title for that pattern. Wusage will count
the total number of accesses to and bytes served
of that pattern, and in the case of daily,
weekly and monthly reports, a bar graph of that pattern's
popularity over time will be generated. <strong>A separate 
bar chart is generated for each item.</strong> To compare several
items on the same bar chart, see the 
<a href="totalsgroup.html"><code>totalsgroup</code> option.</a> 
<p>
The two patterns shown above match all
documents and the home page document,
respectively. Each character of each document name 
is matched against each pattern in the
<code>totals</code> list. An <code>*</code> in a pattern 
matches any number of characters in a document name. 
Patterns have additional features; for more information,
see the <code><a href="patterns.html">patterns</a></code>
section. If the <code>totals ... end totals</code>
option is not specified, no totals will be
generated. 
<p>
The <code>totals</code> option may appear as many times
as desired, usually in alternation with 
<code><a href="totalsgroup.html">totalsgroup</a></code>
options, but the same pattern should not appear
more than once.
