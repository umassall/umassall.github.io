<h2>What is wusage?</h2>
</a>
Wusage is a statistics system that helps you determine
the true impact of your web server. By measuring the
popularity of your documents, as well as identifying
the sites that access your server most often, wusage
provides <strong>valuable marketing information.</strong> 
By determining the paths your users follow and analyzing
the sites from which they come, Wusage helps you find out
which outside sites are most important to you.
Practically all organizations, whether commercial or educational
or nonprofit, need solid numbers to make credible
claims about the World Wide Web. Wusage fills that need.
<p>
Evaluation copies of wusage are provided free to
enable you to determine its suitability for your
needs. After 30 days, you are expected to

in order to continue using it. Steep discounts
are provided to educational and nonprofit
institutions. Near the end of the evaluation
period, wusage will begin to remind you that
your registration is due.
