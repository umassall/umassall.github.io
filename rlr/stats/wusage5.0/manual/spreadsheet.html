<h2>Wusage and Your Spreadsheet Software</h2>
</a>
Many administrators wish to create additional reports
beyond those produced by wusage. A good way to do this
is to import the wusage database into your spreadsheet.
Fortunately, this is very straightforward.
<p>
The file <code>database.dat</code>, found in your
report directory, contains the historical data used
by wusage to generate its historical graphs. This data
is stored as tab-delimited ASCII, which any spreadsheet
program can open directly. 
<p>
The first row contains titles identifying each of
the totals you have configured using the
<code><a href="totals.html">totals</a></code> option.
Each subsequent row contains the date at which
the time period began, the number of days in the
time period (always 1 or 7 at this time), and
the amount of activity (both accesses and bytes
if your server log contains bytes transmitted information) 
for each of your totals during that time period.
<p>
<strong>It is not recommended that you alter and save
changes to the database.dat file.</strong> However, if you do,
keep in mind that the file must continue to contain
tab-delimited ASCII only, the number of columns
should not change, and the "days" column must
contain either 1 or 7 for each time period
(day or week).
