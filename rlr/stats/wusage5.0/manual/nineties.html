<a name="tagl"><h3>Tagliatelle in a Fresh Basil and Walnut Sauce</h3></a>
Serves 4<br>

<i>This is a very rich pasta dish. I usually use tagliatelle which are flat,
ribbon noodles but for a change I use pappardelle. These are broader noodles
which sometimes have wavy edges.</i>
<ul>

<li>salt and pepper
</ul>
Sauce:
<ul>
<li>2 sweet ripe tomatoes

<li>handful of torn fresh basil leaves
<li>2oz / 50g walnut pieces
<li>3tbsp / 45ml single cream
<li>sprigs of fresh basil to garnish
</ul>
1. Cook the pasta in boiling salted water as directed on the packet.
<p>
2. Put the tomatoes in a bowl, cover with boiling water for about 40 seconds,
then plunge into cold water. Peel off the skins. Crush the garlic.
<p>
3. Put the tomatoes, garlic, pepper, Parmesan cheese and parsley in a food
processor and blend to a smooth paste. Gradually add the olive oil, drop by
drop, then add the basil and walnuts. 
<p>
4. Drain the pasta and toss in the walnut sauce and cream. Garnish with
sprigs of basil and serve at once with Parmesan cheese.

<a name="foca"><h3>Focaccia</h3></a>
Makes 1 loaf<br>

<i>This flat bread, found throughout Italy, varies from region to region by
the addition of a simple seasoned topping. This one is topped with crushed
garlic and rosemary and is my favourite. It is traditionally eaten as a
snack.</i>
<ul>
<li>&#189;oz / 15g fresh yeast or 1&#189;tsp dried yeast and a pinch of sugar
<li>8oz / 225g strong white unbleached flour
<li>1tsp salt
<li>3-4tbsp / 45-60ml olive oil
<li>1 garlic clove
<li>2tsp dried rosemary
</ul>
1. Cream the fresh yeast with 3tbsp / 45ml hand-hot water. If using dried 
yeast, sprinkle it on to 3tbsp / 45ml hand hot water with the sugar and 
leave in a warm place for 15 minutes until frothy.
<p>
2. Put the flour on a clean working surface. Gently mix in the salt, then 
form into a mound with a hollow in the centre.
<p>
3. Pour the yeast liquid into the hollow and carefully fold the flour over 
it, then add 3tbsp / 45ml olive oil Add about 4floz / 100ml hand-hot water
to make a stiff but pliable dough. Knead for 10-15 minutes.
<p>
4. Put the dough in a bowl and cover with a clean tea-towel. Leave in a warm
place for about 30 minutes, until doubled in size.
<p>
5. Preheat the oven to 200&#176;C/400&#176;F/Gas Mark 6. On a lightly 
floured surface, roll out the dough to a round about &#188;in / 0.5cm thick.
<p>
6. Brush a baking tray with some of the olive oil and place the dough on the
tray. Crush the garlic, put in a bowl and add some more of the oil. Brush on
to the dough and sprinkle with salt and rosemary.
<p>
7. Bake for 10 minutes, then reduce heat to 190&#176;C/375&#176;F/Gas Mark 5
and bake for a further 20 minutes. Serve hot.

<a name="prun"><h3>Prune and Chocolate Bread</h3></a>

Makes 2 x 1lb / 450g loaves<br>
<i>I adore prunes and wish they were taken more seriously. They are an
excellent source of Vitamin A with iron and fibre. The combination of prunes
and chocolate is heavenly.</i>
<ul>
<li>&#190;oz / 20g fresh yeast or 1tbsp dried yeast and 1tsp sugar
<li>1&#189;1b / 750g strong white unbleached flour
<li>2tsp salt
<li>12oz / 375g stoned prunes 
<li>12oz / 375g plain chocolate
<li>&#190;oz / 20g butter
<li>1 egg
</ul>
1. Grease a 2lb / 900g loaf tin, two 1lb / 450g loaf tins or a baking tray. 
Bend the fresh yeast with &#190;pt / 450ml hand-hot water. If using dried
yeast, sprinkle it on to the hand-hot water with the sugar and leave in a
warm place for 15 minutes until frothy.
<p>
2. Mix the flour and salt together well. Make a reservoir in the centre with
a wooden spoon.
<p>
3. Gradually add about &#190; of the yeast liquid to the flour and mix well 
together. (I find that different flours absorb different amounts of liquid, 
so I never add all the liquid at once.) The dough should be firm and leave 
the sides of the bowl clean. If it looks dry, add some of the remaining 
yeast liquid.
<p>
4. Lightly flour a work surface and turn the dough out. Knead well for 15
minutes - you should end up with a smooth, elastic dough.
<p>
5. Return the dough to a clean bowl, cover with a clean tea-towel and leave
to rise somewhere warm and free of draughts for 1 hour, until doubled in
size. Meanwhile, chop the prunes, chocolate and butter. Beat the egg.
<p>
6. Turn the dough back on to a lightly-floured work surface and knead again
to knock out the air bubbles. It will return to its original size. Add the
prunes, chocolate, butter and beaten egg and knead well for 10 minutes.
<p>
7. Divide and put dough in the prepared tins or shape into ovals and place on
the baking tray. Allow to rise for 10 minutes.
<p>
8. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 220&#176;C/425&#176;F/Gas Mark 7. Bake the 
loaves for 35 minutes.
<p>
9. Leave to cool on a wire rack. Serve warm - the chocolate should be melted
and the prunes juicy.

<a name="fres"><h3>Fresh Egg Pasta</h3></a>

Serves 6-8<br>
<i>This is my basic pasta recipe. The dough can be kept in the fridge in an
airtight container for 2-3 days or frozen for 1 month. Try to find '00' 
Italian flour as this will give the best results.</i>
<ul>
<li>1lb / 500g '00' Italian flour or plain flour
<li>5 eggs
<li>salt
<li>semolina for sprinkling
</ul>
1. Put the flour, eggs and a good pinch of salt in a food processor and mix
until it forms a dough.
<p>
2. If using plain flour, put the dough in a polythene bag and refrigerate for
at least 30 minutes before rolling out.
<p>
3. To shape: cut dough in two and cover one half with a polythene bag. Roll
remaining half out into a rectangle. Roll out until almost paper thin,
sprinkling the surface with semolina if it begins to stick. Carefully
transfer the sheet of pasta  to a clean tea-towel, which has been sprinkled
with semolina. Leave to rest for about 1 hour. Do not allow the pasta to dry
out too much. Repeat with the remaining dough.
<p>
4. Using a sharp knife or pastry wheel, cut the sheets of pasta into the
required shapes. Spread cut pasta out on to a clean tea-towel. Use within 24
hours.
<p>
5. To cook: bring a large saucepan of salted water to the boil then add the 
pasta. Return to the boil and cook for 2-3 minutes. Drain and serve.

<h3>Varieties of Fresh Pasta</h3>

By adding extra ingredients, a variety of different flavoured and coloured 
pasta can be made.
<p>
<b>Spinach Pasta:</b> Cook 8oz / 225g young tender spinach in only the water
that clings to the leaves after washing for 5 minutes, or until tender.
Drain well, squeeze out the water and pur&eacute;e in a food processor. Add
to the flour mixture.
<p>
<b>Tomato Pasta:</b> Add 2tbsp sun-dried tomato pur&eacute;e (see recipe
below) and 1tbsp chopped fresh herbs to the flour mixture.
<p>
<b>Saffron Pasta:</b> Add a large pinch of saffron to the flour mixture.
