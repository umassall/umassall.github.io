<h2>Tips for Virtual Server Administrators</h2>

If you serve many "virtual" domains from the same physical
machine or machines, this section will be of interest to you.
<p>
<strong>Important pricing note:</strong> Boutell.Com requires
that you purchase a license for the number of domains you
will analyze. However, we have a <strong>special ISP price
of just $300</strong> which allows you to analyze <strong>all of
the virtual domains which you serve from a single
physical location.</strong>
<p>
<strong>If your server logs accesses for each virtual
domain to a separate file,</strong> you do not need to
take any special steps to use Wusage. Just set up a configuration
file for each virtual domain in the normal manner.
<p>
<strong>If your server logs all accesses for all
virtual domains to the same log file,</strong> you will
want to examine the <code><a href="servername.html">servername</a></code>
option, which allows you to indicate which virtual domain
should be analyzed in a particular configuration. <strong>
This only works if the virtual domain name is listed for
each log entry.</strong> Most multiple-domain servers
will do this, but certain Netscape servers unfortunately
do not. For those servers there is unfortunately no way to
determine which access applies to each server. <strong>See your log
files and your server's documentation for more information.</strong>
