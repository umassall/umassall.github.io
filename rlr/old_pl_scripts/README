These files were copied into here on 9/11/03. 
Here are their original locations: 

rlr//cgi-bin/rlr/counter/counter.pl
rlr/cgi-bin/rlr/pub.pl
rlr/cgi-bin/rlr/reg.mult.pl

I'm modifying them because: 
 Looks like some of these scripts (e.g.
/nfs/entropy/p3/www-anw/httpd/htdocs/rlr/reg.pl) explicitly reference
/exp/rcf/share/bin/perl, which doesn't exist under linux. Change those
references to /usr/bin/perl and you should be all set.

(occured after the switch to entropy). 

I cound these files with :

grep -rl "/exp/rcf/share/bin/perl" ./* > crapola.txt

from the directory: 
/nfs/entropy/p3/www-anw/httpd/htdocs/rlr/
