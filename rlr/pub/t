<BR><BR><B>Abstract</B>: Markov decision problems (MDPs) provide the foundations for a number
of problems of interest to AI researchers studying automated planning
and reinforcement learning.  In this paper, we summarize results
regarding the complexity of solving MDPs and the running time of MDP
solution algorithms.  We argue that, although MDPs can be solved
efficiently in theory, more study is needed to reveal practical
algorithms for solving large problems quickly .  To encourage future
research, we sketch some alternative methods of analysis that rely on
the structure of MDPs.
