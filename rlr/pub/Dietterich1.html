<BR><BR><B>Abstract</B>: We apply reinforcement learning methods to learn domain-specific
heuristics for job shop scheduling.  A repair-based scheduler starts
with a critical-path schedule and incrementally repairs constraint
violations with the goal of finding a short conflict-free schedule.
The temporal difference algorithm TD() is applied to train a neural
network to learn a heuristic evaluation function over states.  This
evaluation function is used by a one-step lookahead search procedure
to find good solutions to new scheduling problems.  We evaluate this
approach on synthetic problems and on problems from a NASA space
shuttle payload processing task.  The evaluation function is trained
on problems involving a small number of jobs and then tested on larger
problems.  The TD scheduler performs better than the best known
existing algorithm for this task - Zweben's iterative repair method based
on simulated annealing.  The results suggest that reinforcement
learning can provide a new method for constructing high-performance
scheduling systems.
