<BR><BR><B>Abstract</B>: We examine the problem of performing exact dynamic-programming updates
in partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) from a
computational complexity viewpoint.  Dynamic-programming updates are
a crucial operation in a wide range of POMDP solution methods and we 
find that it is intractable to perform these updates on piecewise-linear
convex value functions for general POMDPs.  We offer a new algorithm,
called the witness algorithm, which can compute updated value functions
efficiently on a restricted class of POMDPs in which the number of
linear facets is not too great.  We compare the witness algorithm to
existing algorithms analytically and empirically and find that it is the
fastest algorithm over a wide range of POMDP sizes.
