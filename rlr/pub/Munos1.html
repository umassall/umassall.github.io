<BR><BR><B>Abstract</B>: This paper is concerned with the problem of Reinforcement Learning for continuous state
 space and time stochastic control problems. We state the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation
 satisfied by the value function and use a Finite-Difference method for designing a convergent
 approximation scheme. Then we propose a RL algorithm based on this scheme and prove its
 convergence to the optimal solution.
