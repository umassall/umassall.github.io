<BR><BR><B>Abstract</B>: We develop a methodological framework and present a few 
different ways in which dynamic programming and compact representations can 
be combined to solve large scale stochastic control problems.  In particular, 
we develop algorithms that employ two types of feature-based compact 
representations; that is, representations that involve
feature extraction and a relatively simple approximation architecture.
We prove the  convergence of these algorithms 
and provide bounds on the approximation error.  As an example, one of these 
algorithms is used to generate a strategy for the game of Tetris. 
Furthermore, we provide a counter-example illustrating the
difficulties of integrating compact representations with dynamic programming,
which exemplifies the shortcomings of certain simple approaches.
