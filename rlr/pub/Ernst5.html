<BR><BR><B>Abstract</B>: We derive an  algorithm for selecting from the set of samples gathered by a reinforcement learning agent interacting with a deterministic  environment, a concise  set from which the  agent can extract a good policy.

The reinforcement learning agent is assumed to extract policies from sets of samples by solving a sequence of  standard  supervised learning regression problems. To identify concise sets, we adopt a criterion based on an error function defined from the sequence of models produced by the supervised learning algorithm.

We evaluate our approach on two-dimensional maze problems and show its good performances when problems are continuous.
