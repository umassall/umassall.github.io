<BR><BR><B>Abstract</B>: 
This thesis looks at the problem of situated learning agents operating in real-world environments.  It 
presents a reinforcement learning system which dynamically develops a connectionist model of its 
environment while learning.  The learned model addresses both input-generalisation as well as hidden-state 
(temporal learning). The system is intended for non-stationary, non-deterministic environments which 
contain hidden-state. The system is demonstrated on some common input-generalisation and hidden-state 
problems and also on a simple problem which demonstrates its potential for on-line planning.
