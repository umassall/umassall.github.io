<BR><BR><B>Abstract</B>: This paper studies two changes to XCS, a classifier system in which 
fitness is based on prediction accuracy and the genetic algorithm
takes place in environmental niches.  The changes were aimed at
increasing XCS's tendency to evolve accurate, maximally general
classifiers and were tested on previously employed "woods" and
multiplexer tasks.  Together the changes bring XCS close to evolving
populations whose high-fitness classifiers form a near-minimal, 
accurate, maximally general cover of the input and action product 
space.  In addition, results on the multiplexer, a difficult
categorization task, suggest that XCS's learning complexity is
polynomial in the input length and thus may avoid the "curse of
dimensionality", a notorious barrier to scale-up.  A comparison
between XCS and genetic programming in solving the 6-multiplexer
suggests that XCS's learning rate is about three orders of magnitude
faster in terms of the number of input instances processed.
