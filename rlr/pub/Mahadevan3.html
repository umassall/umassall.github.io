<BR><BR><B>Abstract</B>: This paper describes a general approach for automatically programming
a behavior-based robot.  New behaviors are learned by trial and error
using a performance feedback function as reinforcement.  Two algorithms
for behavior learning are described that combine Q learning, a well
known scheme for propagating reinforcement values temporally across
actions, with statistical clustering and Hamming distance, two ways of 
propagating reinforcement values spatially across states.  A real
behavior-based robot called OBELIX is described that learns several
component behaviors in an example task involving pushing boxes.  A
simulator for the box pushing task is also used to gather data on the
learning techniques.  A detailed experimental study using the real
robot and the simulator suggests two conclusions.  One, the learning
techniques are able to learn the individual behaviors, sometimes
outperforming a handcoded program.  Two, using a behavior-based 
architecture speeds up reinforcement learning by converting the 
problem of learning a complex task into that of learning a simpler
set of special-purpose reactive subtasks.
