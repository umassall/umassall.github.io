<BR><BR><B>Abstract</B>: We present and solve a real-world problem of learning to ride a bicycle. We
solve the problem by online reinforcement learning using the
Sarsa(lambda)-algorithm.  Then we solve the composite problem of
learning to balance a bicycle and then ride to a goal.  In our approach the
reinforcement function is independent of what task the agent tries to learn
to solve.
