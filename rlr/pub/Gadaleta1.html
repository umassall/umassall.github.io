<BR><BR><B>Abstract</B>: A general purpose chaos control algorithm based on reinforcement learning is 
introduced and applied to the control of chaotic systems
and to the targeting problem.
The algorithm does not require any information about the dynamical system or the location
of periodic orbits.
The computationla complexity of the problem is reduced 
through approximation of the phase space by means of the Neural-Gas vector quantization 
technique.
