<BR><BR><B>Abstract</B>: Reinforcement learning has recently been receiving increased
attention as a method for robot learning with little or no a priori
knowledge and higher capability of reactive and adaptive behaviors.
However, there are two major problems in applying it to real robot
tasks: how to construct the state space, and how to reduce the 
learning time.  This paper presents a method by which a robot learns
purposive behavior within less learning time by incrementally 
segmenting the sensor space based on the experiences of the robot.
The incremental segmentation is performed by constructing local
models in the state space, which is based on the function 
approximation of the sensor outputs to reduce the learning time and
on the reinforcement signal to emerge a purposive behavior.  The
method is applied to a soccer robot which tries to shoot a ball into
a goal.  The experiments with computer simulations and a real robot
are shown.  As a result, our real robot has learned a shooting
behavior within less than one hour training by incrementally
segmenting the state space.
