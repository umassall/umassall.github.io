<BR><BR><B>Abstract</B>: We consider the problem of reinforcement learning in
factored-state MDPs in the setting in which learning
is conducted in one long trial with no resets allowed.
We show how to extend existing efficient algorithms
that learn the conditional probability tables of dynamic
Bayesian networks (DBNs) given their structure to the
case in which DBN structure is not known in advance.
Our method learns the DBN structures as part of the
reinforcement-learning process and provably provides
an efficient learning algorithm when combined with factored
Rmax.
