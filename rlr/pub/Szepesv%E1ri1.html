<BR><BR><B>Abstract</B>: In this article we prove the validity of the Bellman Optimality Equation and related results for sequential decision problems with a general recursive structure. The characteristic feature of our approach is that also non-Markovian policies are taken into account. The theory is motivated by some experiments with a learning robot.
