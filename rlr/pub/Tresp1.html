<BR><BR><B>Abstract</B>: This paper is now of mostly historical importance. At the time of
publication (1995) it was one of the first machine learning papers
to stress the importance of stochastic sampling in time-series
prediction and time-series model learning. In this paper we
suggested to use Gibbs sampling, nowadays particle filters are
commonly used instead. Secondly, this is one of the first papers
in machine learning to derive the gradient equations for control
optimization in reinforcement learning policy-space search
methods.  Since our paper was addressed to a neural network
community, we focussed on a neural network representation with
Gaussian noise.
