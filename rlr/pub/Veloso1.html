<BR><BR><B>Abstract</B>: Sony has provided a remarkable platform for research and development in robotic agents, namely fully autonomous
     legged robots. In this paper, we describe our work using Sony's legged robots to participate at the RoboCup'98 legged robot
     demonstration and competition. Robotic soccer represents a very challenging environment for research into systems with multiple
     robots that need to achieve concrete objectives, particularly in the presence of an adversary. Furthermore RoboCup'98 offers an
     excellent opportunity for robot entertainment. We introduce the RoboCup context and briefly present Sony's legged robot. We
     developed a vision-based navigation and a Bayesian localization algorithm. Team strategy is achieved through pre-defined
     behaviors and learning by instruction.
