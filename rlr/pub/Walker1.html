<BR><BR><B>Abstract</B>: In the past several years, it has become possible to build spoken
dialogue systems that can communicate with humans over the telephone
in real time.  Systems exist for tasks such as finding a good
restaurant nearby, reading your email, perusing the classified
advertisements about cars for sale, or making travel arrangements.
These systems are some of the few realized examples of real time,
goal-oriented interactions between humans and computers. Yet in spite
of 30 years of research on algorithms for dialogue management in
task-oriented dialogue systems, the design of the dialogue manager in
real-time, implemented systems is still more of an art than a
science. This article describes a novel method using reinforcement
learning, and experiments that validate the method, by which a spoken
dialogue system can learn from its experience with human users
to optimize its choice of dialogue strategy.
