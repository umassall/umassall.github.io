<BR><BR><B>Abstract</B>: We introduce a methodology to design reinforcement based control
architectures for autonomous robots.  It aims at systematizing the
behavior analysis and the controller design.  The methodology has to
be seen as a conceptual framework in which a number of methods are to
be defined. In this paper we use some more or less known methods to
show the feasibility of the methodology. The postman-robot case study
illustrates how the proposed methodology is applied.
