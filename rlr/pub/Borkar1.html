<BR><BR><B>Abstract</B>: The actor-critic algorithm of Barto et al for simulation-based optimization of Markov decision processes is cast as a two time scale stochastic approximation. Convergence analysis, approximation issues and an example are studied. 
Keywords: Actor-critic algorithm, stochastic approximation, Markov decision processes, simulation-based algorithms, policy iteration.
