<BR><BR><B>Abstract</B>: This paper surveys the field of reinforcement learning from a 
computer-science perspective.  It is written to be accessible to
researchers familiar with machine learning.  Both the historical
basis of the field and a broad selection of current work are
summarized.  Reinforcement learning is the problem faced by an agent
that learns behavior through trial-and-error interactions with a
dynamic environment.  The work described here has a resemblance to work
in psychology, but differs considerably in the details and in the use
of the word "reinforcement".  The paper discusses central issues of
reinforcement learning, including trading off exploration and
exploitation, establishing the foundations of the field vai Markov
decision theory, learning from delayed reinforcement, constructing
empirical models to accelerate learning, making use of generalization
and hierarchy, and coding with hidden state.  It concludes with a survey
of some implemented systems and an assessment of the practical utility
of current methods for reinforcement learning.
