<BR><BR><B>Abstract</B>: This paper addresses the problem of computing optimal structured treatment interruption strategies for HIV infected patients. We show
that reinforcement learning may be useful to extract such strategies
directly from clinical data, without the need of an accurate mathematical model of HIV infection dynamics. To support our claims,
we report simulation results obtained by running a recently proposed
batch-mode reinforcement learning algorithm, known as fitted Q iteration, on numerically generated data.
