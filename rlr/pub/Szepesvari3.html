<BR><BR><B>Abstract</B>: It is shown that for discounted minimax sequential decision processes the evaluation function of a stationary policy is the fixed point of the so-called policy evaluation operator which is a contraction mapping. Using this we prove that Bellman's principle of optimality holds. We also prove that the asynchronous value iteration algorithm converges to the optimal value function.
