<BR><BR><B>Abstract</B>: This paper presents NeuroChess, a program which learns to play chess from the final
outcome of games. NeuroChess learns chess board evaluation functions, represented by
artificial neural networks. It integrates inductive neural network learning, temporal
differencing, and a variant of explanation-based learning. Performance results illustrate
some of the strengths and weaknesses of this approach.
