<BR><BR><B>Abstract</B>: A general technique is proposed for
embedding on-line clustering algorithms based on competitive
learning in a reinforcement
learning framework. The basic idea is that the clustering
system can be viewed as a reinforcement learning system
that learns through reinforcements to follow the clustering
strategy we wish to implement. In this sense,
the RGCL (Reinforcement Guided Competitive Learning)
algorithm is proposed  that constitutes a reinforcement-based
adaptation of LVQ with enhanced clustering capabilities.
In addition, we suggest extensions of RGCL and LVQ that are characterized
by the property of sustained exploration and significantly improve
the performance of those algorithms  as indicated by experimental tests
on well-known datasets.
