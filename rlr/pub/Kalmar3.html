<BR><BR><B>Abstract</B>: This is an early approach to introduce generalization in RL.

A model of adaptive autonomous agents, that (i) builds internal representation of events an d event relations, (ii) utilizes activation spreading for building dynamic concepts and (iii) makes use of the winner-take-all paradigm to come to a decision is extended by introducing generalization into the model. The generalization reduces memory requirements and improves performance in unseen scenes as it is indicated by computer simulations.
