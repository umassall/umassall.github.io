<BR><BR><B>Abstract</B>: Reinforcement learning has proven to be a set of successful techniques for finding optimal policies on uncertain
and/or dynamic domains, such as the RoboCup. One of the problems on using such techniques appears with large state and
action spaces, as it is the case of input information coming from the Robosoccer simulator. In this paper, we describe a new
mechanism for solving the states generalization problem in reinforcement learning algorithms. This clustering mechanism is
based on the vector quantization technique for signal analog-to-digital conversion and compression, and on the Generalized
Lloyd Algorithm for the design of vector quantizers. We show some results on applying this technique to learning the
interception task skill for Robosoccer agents.
