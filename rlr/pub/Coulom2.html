<BR><BR><B>Abstract</B>: Local linear function approximators are often preferred to feedforward neural networks to estimate value functions in reinforcement learning. Still, motor tasks usually solved by this kind of methods have a low-dimensional state space. This article demonstrates that feedforward neural networks can be applied successfully to high-dimensional problems. The main difficulties of using backpropagation networks in reinforcement learning are reviewed, and a simple method to perform gradient descent efficiently is proposed. It was tested successfully on an original task of learning to swim by a complex simulated articulated robot, with 4 control variables and 12 independent state variables.
