<BR><BR><B>Abstract</B>: In order to remain viable and to reproduce an animal has to 
continuously deal with the problem of choosing the right behavior 
among several others (e.g. obtaining food, obtaining water, avoiding
predators, \ldots) at the right time. In robotics this problem arises
when we want to synthesize a complex behavior from elementary
behaviors. Within the reinforcement learning framework we review the
behaviors coordination methods proposed so far. Then we discuss
their limitations and propose a new coordination method based on the restless
bandits theory. Restless bandits allocation indexes are an extension
of the Gittins indexes and are borrowed from the field of optimal
scheduling. They concern problems involving the sharing of limited
resources between several projects which are being pursued. The
performance of the proposed method is illustrated through the
postman robot problem and compared to the Hierarchical Q-learning.
