<BR><BR><B>Abstract</B>: TD Gammon is a neural network that is able to teach itself to play
backgammon soley by playing against itself and learning from the
results, based on the TD(Lambda) reinforcment learning algorithm
(Sutton, 1988).  Despite starting from random initial weights (and
hence random initial strategy), TD Gammon achieves a surprisingly
strong level of play.  With zero knowledge built in at the start of
learning (i.e. given only a "raw" description of the board state), the
network learns to play at a strong intermediate level.  Furthermore,
when a set of hand crafted features is added to the network's input
representation, the result is a truly staggering level of performance:
the latest version of TD Gammon is now estimated to play at a strong
master level that is extremely close to the world's best human players.
