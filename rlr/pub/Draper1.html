<BR><B>Abstract</B>: Most AI representations and algorithms for plan generation have not
included the concept of information-producing actions (also called
diagnostics, or test, in the decision making literature).  We present
a planning representation and algorithm that models information-producing
actions and constructs plans that exploit the information produced
by those actions.  We extend the BURIDAN (Kushmerick <i>et al.</i> 1994)
probabilistic planning algorithm, adapting the action representation
to model the behavior of imperfect sensors, and combine it with a
framework for contingent action that extends the CNLP algorithm (Peot
and Smith 1992) for conditional execution.  The result, C-BURIDAN, is an
implemented planner that builds plans with probabilistic information-producing
actions and contingent execution.
