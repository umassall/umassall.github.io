<BR><B>Abstract</B>: The problem of planning under uncertainty has been addressed by
researchers in many different fields, adopting rather different
perspectives on the problem.  Unfortunately, these researchers are
not always aware of the relationships among these different problem
formulations, often resulting in confusion and duplicated effort.  
Many probabilistic planning or decision making problems can be 
characterized as a class of Markov decision processes that allow for 
significant compression in representing the underlying system dynamics.
It is for this class of problems that we as experts in intensional 
representations are advantageously positioned to contribute efficient
solution methods.  This paper provides a general characterization of
the representational requirements for this class of problems, and we
describe how to achieve computational levereage using representations
that make different types of dependency information explicit.
