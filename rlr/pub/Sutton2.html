<BR><BR><B>Abstract</B>: This paper presents the basic results and ideas of dynamic
       programming as they relate most directly to the concerns of planning in AI.
       These form the theoretical basis for the incremental planning methods used in
       the integrated architecture Dyna. These incremental planning methods are
       based on continually updating an evaluation function and the situation-action
       mapping of a reactive system. Actions are generated by the reactive system
       and thus involve minimal delay, while the incremental planning process
       guarantees that the actions and evaluation function will eventually be
       optimal---% no matter how extensive a search is required. These methods
       are well suited to stochastic tasks and to tasks in which a complete and
       accurate model is not available. For tasks too large to implement the
       situation-action mapping as a table, supervised-learning methods must be
       used, and their capabilities remain a significant limitation of the approach.
