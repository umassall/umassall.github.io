<BR><B>Abstract</B>: This paper describes the application of reinforcement learning (RL)
to the difficult real world problem of elevator dispatching.  The
elevator domain poses a combination of challenges not seen in most
RL research to date.  Elevator systems operate in continuous state
spaces and in continuous time as discrete event dynamic systems.  Their
states are not fully observable and they are nonstationary due to 
changing passenger arrival rates.  In addition, we use a team of RL 
agents, each of which is responsible for controlling one elevator car.
The team receives a global reinforcement signal which appears noisy
to each agent due to the effects of the actions of the other agents,
the random nature of the arrivals and the incomplete observation of 
the state.  In spite of these complications, we show results that in
simulations surpass the best of the heuristic elevator control 
algorithms of which we are aware.  These results demonstrate the 
power of RL on a very large scale stochastic dynamic optimization
problem of practical utility.
