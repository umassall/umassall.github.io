<BR><BR><B>Abstract</B>: Neural network models offer a theoretical testbed for the study of 
learning at the network level. The only experimentally verified 
learning rule, Hebb's rule, is extremely limited in its ability to 
train networks to perform complex tasks. An identified cellular 
mechanism responsible for Hebbian-type long-term potentiation, 
the NMDA receptor, is highly versatile.  Its operation is modulated 
by a wide variety of conditions and may be involved in in several 
non-Hebbian processes. We have shown that another neural network 
learning rule, the chemotaxis algorithm, is theoretically much more 
powerful than Hebb's rule and is consistent with neurobiological 
observations. A biased random-walk in synaptic weight space is a 
learning rule immanent in nervous activity and may account for 
some types of learning -- notably the acquisition of skilled movement.
