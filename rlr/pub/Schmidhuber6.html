<BR><BR><B>Abstract</B>: The ultimate predictive
world model is Solomonoff's Bayesian induction scheme based on
the universal prior M, the enumerable weighted sum of all
enumerable measures. In theory we may use M online to predict
consequences of future action sequences, always choosing
those with highest predicted success. This approach yields
Hutter's (IDSIA) optimal general reinforcement learner AIXI.
M and AIXI are incomputable though. But we provide links to
computable RL methods that still are optimal in a certain sense.
