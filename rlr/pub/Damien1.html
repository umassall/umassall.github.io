<BR><BR><B>Abstract</B>: In this paper we explore how a computational approach to learning from
interactions, called  Reinforcement Learning  (RL), can be  applied to
control power systems. We describe some challenges in power system
control and discuss how some of those challenges could be met by using
these RL methods.  The  difficulties associated with their application
to  control power  systems  are  described and  discussed  as well  as
strategies that  can be adopted  to overcome them.   Two reinforcement
learning  modes  are  considered  :  the on-line  mode  in  which  the
interaction occurs with the real power system and the off-line mode in
which the interaction occurs with a simulation model of the real power
system.  We present two case  studies made on a 4-machine power system
model.  The  first one concerns the  design by means  of RL algorithms
used in   off-line mode of a dynamic  brake controller.  The second
concerns RL methods used in   on-line mode when applied to control a
Thyristor  Controlled  Series Capacitor  (TCSC)  aimed  to damp  power
system oscillations.
