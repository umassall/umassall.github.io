<BR><BR><B>Abstract</B>: We consider the use of multi-agent systems to control network routing. Conventional 
approaches to this task are based on Ideal Shortest Path routing Algorithm (ISPA),
which in some cases can lead to large global cost. In particular, in 
a simulation of Braess' paradox we see that adding new capacity to a network with 
ISPA agents can decrease overall throughput.

The theory of COllective INtelligence (COIN) design concerns precisely the issue 
of avoiding the side effects of ones action to harm a global utility. We show that
COIN-based routing substantially improves performance and in particular
avoids Braess' paradox.
