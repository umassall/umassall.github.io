<BR><BR><B>Abstract</B>: In this paper we show how various levels of coordinated behavior may 
be achieved in a group of mobile robots by using a model of the 
interaction dynamics between a robot and its environment. We present 
augmented Markov models (AMMs) as a tool for capturing such interaction
dynamics on-line and in real-time, with little computational and 
storage overhead.  We demonstrate the application of the model for resolving
group coordination issues arising from three sources: individual performance,
group affiliation, and group performance.
