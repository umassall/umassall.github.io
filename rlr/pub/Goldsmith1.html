<BR><BR><B>Abstract</B>: We examine the computational complexity of testing and finding small
plans in probabilistic planning domains with succinct representations.
We find that many problems of interest are complete for a variety of
complexity classes: NP, co-NP, PP, NP^PP, co-NP^PP, and PSPACE.  Of
these, the probabilistic classes PP and NP^PP are likely to be of
special interest in the field of uncertainty in artificial
intelligence and are deserving of additional study.  These results
suggest a fruitful direction of future algorithmic development.
