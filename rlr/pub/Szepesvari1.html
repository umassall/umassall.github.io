<BR><BR><B>Abstract</B>: In this paper we show that for discounted MDPs with discount factor \gamma>1/2 the asymptotic rate of convergence of Q-learning is O(1/t^{R(1-\gamma)}) if R(1-\gamma)<1/2 and O(\sqrt{\log\log t/ t}) otherwise provided that the state-action pairs are sampled from a fixed probability distribution. Here R=\pmin/\pmax is the ratio of the minimum and maximum state-action occupation frequencies. The results extend to convergent on-line learning provided that \pmin>0, where \pmin and \pmax now become the minimum and maximum state-action occupation frequencies corresponding to the stationary distribution.

This is a slightly revised version of the paper published in the NIPS proceedings.
