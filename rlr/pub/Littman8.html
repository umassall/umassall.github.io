<BR><BR><B>Abstract</B>: This paper proposes a categorization of reinforcement learning
environments based on the optimization of a reinforcement signal over
time.  Environments are classified by the simplest agent that can
possibly achieve optimal reinforcement.  Two parameters, h and beta,
abstractly characterize the complexity of an agent: the ideal
(h,beta)-agent uses the input information provided by the environment
and at most h bits of local storage to choose an action that maximizes
the discounted sum of the next beta reinforcements.  In an
(h,beta)-environment, an ideal (h,beta)-agent achieves the maximum
possible expected reinforcement for that environment.  The paper
discusses the special cases when either h=0 or beta=1 in detail,
describes some theoretical bounds on h and beta and reexplores a
well-known reinforcement learning environment with this new notation.
