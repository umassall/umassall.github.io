<BR><BR><B>Abstract</B>: We report in this paper some positive simulation results obtained when 
image pixels are directly used as input state of a reinforcement learning algorithm. The reinforcement learning algorithm chosen to carry out the simulation is a batch-mode algorithm known as fitted Q iteration.
