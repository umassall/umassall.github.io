<BR><BR><B>Abstract</B>: This paper introduces the concept of  ``COllective INtelligence'' (COIN). A COIN is a large
multi-agent system where: 

  There is little to no centralized communication or control.
  There is a provided world utility function that rates the possible histories of the full system..

In particular we are interested in COINs in which each agent runs a 
reinforcement learning algorithm. This approach leads to the following
design problem: What rewards functions for the individual agents will,
when successfully pursued by those agents result in high world utility?
