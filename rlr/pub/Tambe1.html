<BR><BR><B>Abstract</B>: Multi-agent collaboration or teamwork and learning are two critical research challenges in a large 
     number of multi-agent applications. These research challenges are highlighted in RoboCup, an international
     project focused on robotic and synthetic soccer as a common testbed for research in multi-agent systems. This
     article describes our approach to address these challenges, based on a team of soccer-playing agents built for the
     simulation league of RoboCup | the most popular of the RoboCup leagues so far. To address the challenge of
     teamwork, we investigate a novel approach based on the (re)use of a domain-independent, explicit model of
     teamwork, an explicitly represented hierarchy of team plans and goals, and a team organization hierarchy based on
     roles and role-relationships. This general approach to teamwork, shown to be applicable in other domains beyond
     RoboCup, both reduces development time and improves teamwork flexibility. We also demonstrate the application
     of off-line and on-line learning to improve and specialize agents' individual skills in RoboCup. These capabilities
     enabled our soccer-playing team, ISIS, to successfully participate in the first international RoboCup soccer
     tournament (RoboCup'97) held in Nagoya, Japan, in August 1997. ISIS won the third-place prize in over 30 teams
     that participated in the simulation league.
