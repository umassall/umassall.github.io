<BR><BR><B>Abstract</B>: This article introduces a class of incremental learning procedures
specialized for prediction - that is, for using past experience with
an incompletely known system to predict future behavior.  Whereas
conventional prediction-learning methods assign credit by means of the
difference between predicted and actual outcomes, the new methods
assign credit by means of the difference between <i>temporally
successive predictions</i>.  Although such <i>temporal difference
methods</i> have been used in Samuel's checker player, Holland's bucket
brigade, and the author's Adaptive Heuristic Critic, they have remained
poorly understood.  Here we prove their convergence and optimality for
special cases and relate them to supervised-learning methods.  For
most real-world prediction problems, temporal-difference methods
require less memory and less peak computation than conventional
methods, and they produce more accurate predictions.  We argue that
most problems to which supervised learning is currently applied are
really prediction problems of the sort to which temporal-difference
methods can be applied to advantage.
