<BR><BR><B>Abstract</B>: In this article we consider Monte-Carlo planning algorithms for planning in continuous state-space, discounted Markovian Decision Problems (MDPs) having a smooth transition law and a finite action space.
We prove various polynomial complexity results for the considered algorithms.
