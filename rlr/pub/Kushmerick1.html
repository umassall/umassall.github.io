<BR><BR><B>Abstract</B>: We define the probabilistic planning problem in terms of a probability
distribution over initial world states, a boolean combination of 
propositions representing the goal, a probability threshold, and actions
whose effects depend on the execution-time state of the world and on
random chance.  Adopting a probabilistic model complicates the definition
of plan success: instead of demanding a plan that <i>provably</i> achieves 
the goal, we seek plans whose probability of success exceeds the threshold.

<p>In this paper, we present BURIDAN, an implemented least-commitment
planner 
that solves problems of this form.  We prove that the algorithm is both sound
and complete.  We then explore BURIDAN's efficiency by contrasting four
algorithms for plan evaluation, using a combination of analytic methods
and empirical experiments.  We also describe the interplay between 
generating plans and evaluating them, and discuss the role of search
control in probabilistic planning.
