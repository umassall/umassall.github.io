<BR><BR><B>Abstract</B>: Algorithms learning the optimal policy of a Markov decision process based on simulated transitions are formulated and analyzed. These are variants of well-known `actor-critic' (or `adaptive critic') algorithm in the artificial intelligence literature. Distributed asynchronous implementations are considered. The analysis involves two time scale stochastic approximations. 
Key words. reinforcement learning, Markov decision processes, actor-critic algorithms, stochastic approximation, asynchronous iterations
