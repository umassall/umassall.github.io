<BR><BR><B>Abstract</B>: Probabilistic networks, which provide compact descriptions of complex
stochastic relationships among several random variables, are rapidly
becoming the tool of choice for uncertain reasoning in artificial
intelligence.  We show that networks with fixed structure containing
hidden variables can be learned automatically from data using a
gradient-descent mechanism similar to that used in neural networks.
We also extend the method to networks with intensionally represented
distributions, including networks with continuous variables and
dynamic probabilistic networks.  Because probabilistic networks 
provide explicit representations of causal structure, human experts can
easily contribute prior knowledge to the training process, thereby
significantly improving the learning rate.  <i>Adaptive probabilistic
networks</i>(APNs) may soon compete directly with neural networks as
models in computational neuroscience as well as in industrial and
financial applications.
