<BR><BR><B>Abstract</B>: This paper describes the Q-routing algorithm for packet routing, in
which a reinforcement learning module is embedded into each node of a
switching network.  Only local communication is used by each node to
keep accurate statistics on which routing decisions lead to minimal
delivery times.  In simple experiments involving a 36-node,
irregularly connected network, Q-routing proves superior to a
nonadaptive algorithm based on precomputed shortest paths and is able
to route efficiently even when critical aspects of the simulation,
such as the network load, are allowed to vary dynamically.  The paper
concludes with a discussion of the tradeoff between discovering
shortcuts and maintaining stable policies.
