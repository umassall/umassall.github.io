<BR><BR><B>Abstract</B>: Most exact algorithms for general partially observable Markov
decision processes (POMDPs) use a form of dynamic programming in
which a piecewise-linear and convex representation of one value
function is transformed into another.  We examine variations of the
"incremental pruning" method for solving this problem and compare
them to earlier algorithms from theoretical and empirical perspectives.
We find that incremental pruning is presently the most efficient exact
method for solving POMDPs.
