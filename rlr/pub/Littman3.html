<BR><BR><B>Abstract</B>: Many representations for probabilistic propositional planning problems
have been studied.  This paper reviews several such representations
and shows that, in spite of superficial differences between the
representations, they are ``expressively equivalent,'' meaning that
planning problems specified in one representation can be converted to
equivalent planning problems in any of the other representations with
at most a polynomial factor increase in the size of the resulting
representation and the number of steps needed to reach the goal with
sufficient probability.  The paper proves that the computational
complexity of determining whether a successful plan exists for
planning problems expressed in any of these representations is
EXPTIME-complete and PSPACE-complete when plans are restricted to take
a polynomial number of steps.
