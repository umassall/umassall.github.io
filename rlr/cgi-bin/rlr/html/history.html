<br>

<img hspace=10 src=images/logos.gif>1.28 28 July 97
      Parsing is now automated for Simulator, Backprop, ValuePolicy, and
      every class of type Display or Plot.
      Changed all the HTML files to reflect the resulting changes in the language.
      <br><br>
<img hspace=10 src=images/logos.gif>1.27 18 July 97
      WebSim now runs on Netscape Win95/WinNT/MacOS/OSF1(DECUnix).
      SunOs 4 and SunOs 5 still crash in the X-windows library.
      Code now allows automated BNF/parse/unparse/setVar/setWatch,
      using the new getParameters method.  Only Grid, Title, Contour, Simulator,
      and PlotXY have been changed so far to use this new feature.
      <br><br>
<img hspace=10 src=images/logos.gif>1.26 4 July 97
      Can now save Postscript as either normal Postscipt or
      a Postscript file representing a single big bitmap.
      <br><br>
<img hspace=10 src=images/logos.gif>1.25 3 July 97
      Bug fixes, especially for many of the unparse() methods and Unparser.java,
      so "save all" menu works better now.  Many of the demos are improved.
      Changes to Directories.java may make it work better on non-Windows platforms.
      <br><br>
<img hspace=10 src=images/logos.gif>1.24 25 June 97
      Improved and debugged many objects, including Graph2D, and ShowEdit.
      Added Grid. Added ReinforcementLearning and changed
      AdvantageLearning, QLearning and ValueIteration accordingly.
      VRML interface now works with Cosmo Player Beta 3a, and the
      demo uses a window embedded in the Web page.
      <br><br>
<img hspace=10 src=images/logos.gif>1.23 17 May 97
      Improved VRML interface.  Reorganized all the Displays..
      <br><br>
<img hspace=10 src=images/logos.gif>1.22 13 May 97
      VRML interface and #DEF/#USE added.
      <br><br>
<img hspace=10 src=images/logos.gif>1.21 12 May 97
      Numerical expressions can now be parsed.  In lists of
      numbers, a list like [1 -2 3] will now have to be written as
      [1 (-2) 3]  or, even better, [1, -2, 3] to avoid the (1-2) being
      interpreted as a single expression.  The list [1 2 3] is still OK.
      Also, the public variable WebSim.watchManager can now be used to
      coordinate different Applets running in the same VM.
      <br><br>
<img hspace=10 src=images/logos.gif>1.20 10 May 97
      Downloading, parsing, and opening new windows are now faster.
      <br><br>
<img hspace=10 src=images/logos.gif>1.19 8 May 97
      Pause/Resume works on Netscape 4.0 beta 3, and the zip files can now
      be read by some unzipping programs that were confused before.
      <br><br>
<img hspace=10 src=images/logos.gif>1.18 6 May 97
      A new class sim.funApp.Net creates neural networks with any number of layers,
      each of which implements radial basis functions, sigmoids, linear functions.
      or various other functions.  It also knows how to calculate its own second
      derivatives.  This obsoletes the old sim.funApp.MLP and sim.funApp.Linear.
      Menus are now in embedded windows, appearing as pulldown choice lists.  (These
      will be converted to proper popup menus as soon as Netscape and IE have nonbeta
      releases supporting Java 1.1).  There is now a "websim" menu on all project windows
      that can pause everything, resume everything, turns graphics on and off,
      and save a snapshot of everything
      to disk as an HTML file.  When that file is loaded in, everything picks up where
      it left off.  Numerous bug fixes and workarounds for Netscape bugs now allow WebSim
      to work fine with Netscape 4.0 beta 3 (which includes a very buggy
      beta of Symantec's jit 2.0).  JAR files are now being used, which work with the
      Netscape beta.
      <br><br>
<img hspace=10 src=images/logos.gif>1.17 18 Apr 97
      A new class, sim.data.RemoteTable, now allows
      Websim to download data sets from the Internet (e.g. the UC Irvine
      repository) and use them for supervised learning, etc.  Also,
      bugs in the unparse() method of many classes have been fixed.
      <br><br>
<img hspace=10 src=images/logos.gif>1.16 15 Apr 97
      A new class, sim.errFun.Batch, now allows pseudo epochwise batch training on infinite
      training sets by averaging together N evaluations of an error function.
      A new class sim.errFun.errAvg now allows several error functions to be combined
      so that gradient descent on their average is actually performed.
      Some bugs are fixed, and the majority of the native code for MatrixD and MatrixF
      is working.
      Also, the the class TestMatrix.java has benchmarking code to see how Java
      compares to C, and the results of some benchmarks are in the comments in
      that file.
      <br><br>
<img hspace=10 src=images/logos.gif>1.15 7 Apr 97
      Bug fixes and some native code for MatrixD.
      <br><br>
<img hspace=10 src=images/logos.gif>1.13 1 Apr 97
      SaveDisplay object now saves a sequence of snapshots of a Display,
      either as a set of separate GIF files, or as a single animated GIF.
      All windows can save images as Postscript now, in addition to GIF.
      The Contour object makes contour plots that can be zoomed in on with
      the mouse.
      The "#" button now brings up many more parameters for
      Graph2D, Graph3D, Contour, ShowEdit.  See the BNF comments for what they mean.
      Parameter windows (ShowEdit windows) now respond to arrow keys.
      The code runs under the Symantec CAFE jit beta, as well as JDK 1.0 and 1.1.
      <br><br>
<img hspace=10 src=images/logos.gif>1.12 20 Feb 97
      Added menu to save as GIF to all windows.
      Created SaveGIF Display to create animations on the hard drive.
      Fixed WebSim so everything stops when you leave the current Web page.
      Minor improvements to ShowEdit and the two buttons in GWin.
      <br><br>
<img hspace=10 src=images/logos.gif>1.11 16 Feb 97.
      Added a second button to each display that shows all
      watchable variables.  Made ShowEdit easier to use.
      Fixed bugs with the behavior of windows.
      <br><br>
<img hspace=10 src=images/logos.gif>1.10 11 Feb 97.
      Replaced ShowNumbers with ShowEdit which allows watchable
      parameters to be editted by the user at runtime.  Converted
      all objects to use parseClass("IntExp",) instead of
      parseInt(), and parseClass("NumExp",) instead of
      parseNum().  Fixed a bug in Random (it wouldn't
      work when given a seed outside a certain range, or
      when generating such a seed from the clock automatically).
      Added the ability to put a title on any window.
      <br><br>
<img hspace=10 src=images/logos.gif>1.01 24 Oct 96.
      Simplified the unparse() method, made BNF() more
      powerful and added new BNF() comments to many classes.
      Much-improved Random and sim.QLearning. Modified MDP/MLP
      interfaces.
      <br><br>
<img hspace=10 src=images/logos.gif>1.00 7 Oct 96. Initial WebSim release.
