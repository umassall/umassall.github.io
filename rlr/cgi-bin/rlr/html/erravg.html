This illustrates gradient descent on the average of two different error functions.
There are two sigmoidal, multilayer perceptrons, both with 3 inputs and two outputs.
(Instead of a specific bias parameter, there is an input that is always 1.0).  Each
layer is fully connected to the next, and weights never connect nonadjacent layers.
Both networks have two hidden layers. The first network has 5 and 4 nodes in
the hidden layers closer to the the input and output respectively.  The second
network has 6 and 3 nodes.  These two topologies happen to have exactly the same number
of weights, since 3*5+5*4+4*1 = 3*6+6*3+3*1 = 39.  In both networks, these weights
are indexed in some arbitrary order.  Both networks are trained to
learn the same saddle-shaped function, but with one constraint: weights with the
same index are constrained to be identical.  Gradient descent is then performed on
the average of two different mean-squared-error functions, to try to find a weight
vector that will make both networks correct.  It is perhaps surprising that it
does this so well, causing both functions to look almost identical during learning.
You almost have to look at the numbers on the Z axis to notice that
the two functions are slightly different before they converge.

Click and drag just outside the boundary of the cube to rotate the
image of the cube, or click and drag inside the the boundary of the cube
to rotate the cube itself.  Click and drag on the contour plot to
zoom in on a smaller region.<p>
