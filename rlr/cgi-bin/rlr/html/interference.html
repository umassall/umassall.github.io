See the
source HTML code for this page to see the simulation definition that
is parsed and executed by the WebSim applet below.<p>

All of this code is (c) 1996,1997 by the respective authors, is freeware, and

<p>
Click and drag just outside the boundary of the cube to rotate the
image of the cube, or click and drag inside the the boundary of the cube
to rotate the cube itself.  Click and drag on the contour plot to
zoom in on a smaller region.<p>
<p>
The 2D plot shows the log of error going down as a multilayer sigmoidal
neural
network learns a function with 5 training samples.  The function is trained to go
through the center of the cube, to be 1 at two corners, and to be 0 at the other two.
<p>
It is interesting to change the learning rate and momentum, then choose "RESTART"
under the "WebSim" menu above the WebSim logo.  These parameters are (0.01,0) at
by default.  Interesting combinations are (0.01,0.9), (0.01,0.99), (0.001,0.999),
and (0.00001,0.9999).  This last combination is particularly interesting if the
autoscaling of the 3D plot is turned off.  To do that, change zMax to 1.
Those bounds and
the learning rate of 0.00001 and momentum of 0.9999 give a good illustration of
how momentum works.
