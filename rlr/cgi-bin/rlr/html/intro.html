WebSim allows a large string to be embedded in the HTML code of a Web page.
This string defines what the program should do, and what objects will be
included in it.  For example, the HTML code might contain:
<pre>
&ltp&gt&ltapplet codebase="../classes" code=WebSim.class width=635 height=650&gt
   &ltparam name=sourceText value=&quot
     (0,0,200,200)
     Simulator {
        experiment SupervisedLearning
          incremental false
          data     table {  //each row is an input vector, output vector
                     [1 0 0] [0]   //  0 XOR 0 = 0
                     [1 0 1] [1]   //  0 XOR 1 = 1
                   }
          funApp   #DEF FUNCTION {Net { Identity Linear Identity }}
          learning Backprop {
                     learningRate .0001 //.1 learns almost instantly
                     momentum  .9
                     tolerance 0 //this was .01, but infinite loops are better
                     smooth    .99
                   }
        displays {
          embed
          (0,0,200,200)
          title {title 'Log error vs. timestep'
            display Graph2D {
              trigger 'time' freq 400
              plots {
                plotXY {
                  size 100
                  lineColor [0 .5 0] symbolColor [0 .8 0]
                  trigger 'time' freq 400
                  x       'time'
                  y       'log error'
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
     }
&quot
&lt/applet&gt
</pre>
(Actually, due to a bug in the current Netscape, the // style comments
only work if each line within the string starts with a back apostrophe).
The code in this example says that the project to run is a simulation.
The simulation has two parts, an experiment, and the display that shows
information about that experiment.  The experiment does supervised learning,
and has 4 parts: whether it is incremental, the data to train on,
the type of function approximator, and which learning algorithm to use.
This little language for describing projects can be defined with a set
of BNF productions, such as:
<pre>
WebSim    ::= ['unparse'] ProjWin*               // the string in the HTML code has this form
ProjWin   ::= ['embed']['(&ltint&gt[',']&ltint&gt[',']   // (x,y,width,height) for the Project's window (-1=default)
              &ltint&gt[',']&ltint&gt] &ltProject&gt
&ltProject&gt ::= 'Simulator'   Simulator |
              'Picture'     Picture   |
              'ShowThreads' ShowThreads
Simulator ::= '{' 'experiment' &ltExperiment&gt      // run a simulation
              'displays' DisplayList '}'
</pre>
This says that WebSim will expect the HTML file to contain a string optionally
starting with &quotunparse&quot, followed by zero or more project windows (ProjWin).
Each project window can start with the optional word &quotembed&quot, which embeds
the window in the web page rather than creating a separate window.  It may
also optionally contain numbers for the shape and location of the window,
which have optional commas between them.  These are then followed by
a project, &ltProject&gt.<p>

This is a fairly standard-looking BNF description of a simple language.
Interestingly, there is a separate WebSim class for each of the nonterminals
WebSim, ProjWin, and Simulator.  Each class has a BNF method that returns a
string containing one entry from the above description.  Each class also knows how
to parse it's own parameters.  So the class Simulator knows that when it is
its turn to parse, it should be able to parse the two curly brackets and the
words &quotexperiment&quot and &quotdisplays&quot.  It also knows that it needs to create
objects of type Experiment and DisplayList, and should let them parse
their own parameters.  In this way, the WebSim parser is distributed
among all the classes.  Each class knows how to parse its own parameters,
and knows who to call to parse other parameters within it.  It even has
a method. BNF(), that returns a string describing what it parses,
so documentation can be generated automatically<p>

This BNF is fairly normal, using single quotes around terminals,
square brackets for optional parts, a &quot*&quot for zero or more
repetitions, a &quot+&quot for one or more repititions, a &quot|&quot for a choice,
and parentheses for grouping whatever the &quot*&quot or &quot+&quot applies to.  There
is one important extension to this notation: there are two types of nonterminals.
A nonterminal without brackets, like &quotSimulator&quot means that
an object should be instantiated
from the class Simulator, and that its parse() method should then be called
so it can parse its own parameters.  A nonterminal in angled brackets,
such as &ltProject&gt means something slightly different.  There must a type
named Project, but it can be either a class or an interface, and it
doesn't have to have any particular methods defined such as BNF() or
parse(), since it will never be instantiated anyway.  Instead,
the string in the HTML file will contain a token at this point which
is the name of a class of type Project.  And <em>that</em> is the class
that is instantiated.  So, the entry:
<pre>
ProjWin   ::= ['embed']['(&ltint&gt[',']&ltint&gt[',']
              &ltint&gt[',']&ltint&gt] &ltProject&gt         // (x,y,width,height) for the Project's window (-1=default)
</pre>
means that the &quotembed&quot and the numbers in parentheses will
be followed by some unknown token, which will be the name of a
class of type Project.  In the example above, the token was
&quotSimulator&quot, which was legal because there is a class called
&quotSimulator&quot, and it does inherit from the class &quotProject&quot.
The BNF description:
<pre>
&ltProject&gt ::= 'Simulator'   Simulator |
              'Picture'     Picture   |
              'ShowThreads' ShowThreads
</pre>
was not a string returned by some BNF() method.  Instead, it can be
generated automatically by checking each class on the disk to see if it
is of type Project.  If it is, then it can be added to the list. Since
this part of the language is generated automatically, new classes can be
added to the language by just compiling them and placing them on the disk.
<p>
This is where WebSim gains its extensibility.  If I want to create a new type
of project, I can simply write a class called &quotMyProject&quot, and make sure it
inherits from Project.  Simply compiling MyProject and putting it on the
disk thus extends the WebSim language.  In the example HTML above, the word
&quotSimulator&quot can be replaced with &quotMyProject&quot, and everything after the
word &quotSimulator&quot can be replaced with whatever parameters MyProject expects.
There is no need to change some special parser object, or change header files,
or recompile anything.  The simple act of placing the file MyProject.class
on the disk automatically extends the language that WebSim understands.
To find out what WebSim currently understands (given a directory full
of WebSim objects), run the project FindBNF, which will generate a full
commented BNF description for all the objects in the directory.<p>

<h1>Writing WebSim Classes</h1>
To work with WebSim, a class must implement parser.Parsable, or inherit from
a class that does.  This ensures that the class will have three methods:
<pre>
  public String BNF(int lang);
  public void   unparse(Unparser u, boolean emitName, int lang);
  public Object parse(Parser p,int lang) throws ParserException;
</pre>
The BNF() method returns a string documenting the parameters that
the class takes.  This allows documentation to be generated
automatically.  The parse() method parses this object's parameters,
sets appropriate local variables, and returns a pointer to itself.
The unparse() method is used to do the opposite.  It allows an
entire set of instantiated objects in RAM to output a complete
description of their state to a text file.  That text file could later
be read as the string in an HTML file to recreate those objects and
that state.  This allows a simulation to store its state periodically
so nothing is lost in a system crash.<p>

It is possible for a class to understand more than one language.
For example, a Sphere class might know how to ray trace a sphere. This
single class might be used to parse POV-RAY files that describe 3D scenes,
and might also be used to parse VRML files that describe 3D scenes in a
different language.  In either case there is a sphere object that does
the same thing, but the particular form and order of its parameters are
different.  That is why BNF(), unparse(), and parse() all take an integer
parameter &quotlang&quot.  This might be zero for parsing POV-RAY and one for
parsing VRML.  In all the WebSim files so far, there is only a single
language, and so this parameter is always zero, but for future
compatability, it is important that each class pass this on to any
other class whose parse() method it calls. <p>

If a WebSim class takes no parameters when being parsed, then the three
methods can use these minimal implementations:
<pre>
  /* Return the BNF description of how to parse the parameters of this object. */
  public abstract String BNF(int lang) {
    return &quot//Brief comment. Format: Double dash, brief comment, dot, long comment&quot;
  }

  /** Output a description of this object that can be parsed with parse().*/
  public abstract void unparse(Unparser u, int lang) {
  }

  /** Parse the input file to get the parameters for this object.
    * @exception parse.ParserException parser didn't find the required token
    */
  public abstract Object parse(Parser p,int lang) throws ParserException {
    return this;
  }
</pre>
The BNF returns nothing but a comment (which always starts with
a //), since there are no parameters.
Similarly, the parse() method has nothing to do, and the unparse()
method has nothing to do except to emit the name of the class (if
asked to do so).  In addition
to implementing Parsable, a new object for WebSim must be of a type that
is defined in the current BNF.  So a new project would have to extend
Project, a new neural network function approximator would extend
FunApp, a new gradient descent algorithm would extend GradDesc, and
a new type of learning algorithm would extend Simulator.  To create
a new class in WebSim, it is probably simplest to start with a copy of
the source code of a similar, existing class, and modify that.
