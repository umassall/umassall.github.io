This document discusses how to upgrade NetForum from version 1.2.x to
2.0.x and NetForum 2.0 beta 3.x to 2.0.x

You will need the NetForum 2.0.x source from 

	http://www.biostat.wisc.edu/netforum/download.html

This will unpack itself into a directory called netforum when you run
the INSTALLME script. You may want to avoid clobbering NF 1.2.x by
moving the pieces of the program to a safe place before running
install. 

Run install and go through the steps to install the program. Do this
first, the upgrade program needs to know a few things about how you
have the program setup and looks in the configuration files for this.
Test out NF 2.0 using the included test forum. Don't get rid of the 
admin owner just yet (but do change its password!)

When you have the new version running you can go about migrating your
old forums to the new format. The new format requires all forums to be
registered in the admin script and old forms are lacking subjects. The
program forum1.2.6_to_2.0 (a perl script) will do this. 

Copy all of the forums you wish to convert to the directory containing
NF 2.0.x We recommend that you keep a backup of these. Even thought the
program has been tested, you never know what odd errors may crop up...

Run the forum1.2.6_to_2.0 program. It will prompt you for a comma
separated list of forums you wish to update. Type them in and hit
return and let the thing go. The forums will be updated and given to
the admin owner for maintenance. 

These forums can now be manipulated as any other NF 2.0 forum. Note
the old versions of these forums will be deleted. 

Upgrading from 3.x beta (or any of the later betas) should be easy:

Be sure to unpack the distribution someplace safe (i.e. you dont want
it to clobber your sys_config, forum config etc. yet...

<P>
The most important thing is to add a name for each administrative user
to the file 'userlist' in the diretory admin. At the end of each line add
a colon (:) (very important!) and then type the name of the user. It should
look something like this:

test:NO:NO:NO:NO:NO:YES:JSvVbXnLJqJ/M:Test Account

on each line. 

Now replace all of the programs in the lib and admin directories:

admin/admin
lib/main
lib/utilities
lib/variables


Now you need to update the forum_config files to adhere to the new
format. There may be one of these in each forum. The simplest way
to do this is to print out the old versions, copy the distributed
new version (found in lib/) overeach and make the changes by hand.


The new version of netforum should run without these modifications
but people typing stuff into forums will wonder why there is a text
box with only  a : above it.








A short FAQ:

Q: forum1.2.6_to_2.0 wont run!

A: You either have the path to perl wrong in it or the current
directory is not in your path. Try 

	shell% ./forum1.2.6_to_2.0 

or 

	shell% perl forum1.2.6_to_2.0

where shell% is your shell prompt (don't type it!)

Q: Will old 1.2.x forums run without conversion

A: Probably, but you cannot use any of the new admin capabilities on
them though.

One note: The conversion script seems to have problems with preformatted
messages. In that case you will have to fix things by hand later as it
screws up the formatting of all following messages.
