This is NetForum 2.0.x To install it, run the INSTALL script
from the command line.

Alternatively, you can do what the install script does: 

o  set your umask to 0 
o  untar nf.tar (or if you have GNU tar use: 'tar xpvf nf.tar')
o  reset your umask

Once NetForum 2.0.x is installed:

1. Configure the sys_config file inside the 'lib' directory according to your 
   site specifications.
2. Move the nf_docs directory somewhere inside the htdocs directory in
   your web server (this is the path you specified in the sys_config file
   for the $docs variable). 
3. Once you have configure the sys_config file, you can run NetForum from 
   any browser that supports tables (i.e., Netscape 2.0). To create forums
   run the admin script from the web by loading NetForum from the web:

http://your.url/your-cgi-directory/your-netforum-directory/admin/admin

  The login and password are: "admin" and "admin" respectively, you may
  want to change the password once you are ready to go.
  If you changed the $perl_path variable in the sys_config file you will
  need to modify the first line of the admin script to the new path
  to perl.

4. Once in the admin script follow these steps:
	* Login
	* Go to Edit Site Configuration
	* Go to Edit Forum Variables
	* Select the button style you prefer as default for all forums
	  in your site (i.e, change $button_path variable).
        * Save variables.

If you have any problems configuring NetForum, please contact your
system administrator before contacting the NetForum development team.
In addition, you will find some help files within the nf_docs directory
(i.e., nf_docs/Docs/OnLine).
