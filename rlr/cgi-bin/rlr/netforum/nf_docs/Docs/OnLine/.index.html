<H2>Configuration</H2>
<HR>
In order to get the admin file running you will need edit some files.
You will need  to configure the following files:
<ul>
  <li> NetForum/lib/sys_config
  <li> NetForum/admin/admin
</ul>
You will also need to change the first line of the following files to 
reflect the path to Perl on your system:

<ul>
  <li> NetForum/lib/sys_config
  <LI> NetForum/lib/forum_config
  <li> NetForum/lib/main
  <LI> NetForum/lib/utilities
  <LI> NetForum/lib/variables
  <li> NetForum/admin/admin
</ul>

If your system requires a <b>.cgi</b> extension for CGI scripts, you will need 
to rename the file:<BR>

<ul>
  <li>NetForum/admin/admin
</ul>

to:

<ul>
  <li>NetForum/admin/admin.cgi 
</ul>

To find the path to perl you can type <CODE>which perl</CODE> at the command
line. This will give you the directory containing perl. Copy this, using
your favorite text editor to each of the files listed above.
Do not remove the text "-si" following the path to Perl<blink>!!</blink>

You will also probably want to customise the file nf_docs/netforum.html<p>


<IMG SRC="../../gifs/install_config.gif" alt="Install Config"><p>
<hr>
<h2>The "sys_config" file</h2>
This is the file where the system-wide configurations are set. It is not where information specific to individual
forums is set.<p>
The first three entries must be configured before the program will run. In your
favorite text editor make the following changes:

<P>
<b>$url = "http://www.biostat.wisc.edu";</b>
<p>
Set the variable "$url" to the full URL of your Web site. Do not place a trailing slash
 (i.e., a "/" at the end).
<Hr>
<p>
<b>$base_url = "cgi-bin/NetForum";</b>
<p>
This is the partial URL to the "NetForum" directory you received. 
Do not place a trailing or a leading slash. ScriptAliases are fine.
<HR>
<p>
<b>$home_directory = "/usr/local/bin/httpd/cgi-bin/NetForum";</b>
<p>
This is the full file system path to the "NetForum" directory you received. 
Place a leading slash, but no trailing slash.
<HR>
<p>

The remaining entries can be configured from the text editor or from
the administrative forums provided with the program.

<P>
Now you should be able to run the admin script. From your favorite web
browser enter the following url: 
<CODE>http://your.web.site/base_url/admin/admin</CODE> 
Where <CODE>your.web.site</CODE> is the machine name at your web
site and <CODE>base_url</CODE> is the directory that the executable lies in.
For example, given the values set above you would type 
<CODE>http://www.biostat.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/NetForum/admin/admin</CODE>
or 
<CODE>http://www.biostat.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/NetForum/admin/admin.cgi</CODE>
if a .cgi extension was required.

<P>
You should see the login screen:

<P>
<IMG SRC="../../gifs/login.gif" ALT="Admin login">

<P>
If you instead get a server error there is most likely a problem in the way you
have one of the system variables configured correctly. You may want to read
the <A HREF="../faq.html">faq</A>. 

<P>
The first time you login you can login as user <EM>admin</EM> with password
<EM>admin</EM> (You will want to change these soon.) 

<P>
This will present you with the NetForum 
<A HREF="maintenance.html">adminsitrative options</A> screen:

<P>
<IMG SRC="../../gifs/admin.ops.gif" ALT="Administrative options">


<BR>

Choose the <EM>Edit Site Configuration</EM> button and hit the submit button
to produce the Edit Site Configuration menu. This menu allows you to configure
options that will take effect across the entire instalation of netforum. 


<P>
<IMG SRC="../../gifs/editsite.gif" ALT="Edit Site Configuration">


<P>
To continue with the setup choose <EM>Edit System Configuration</EM> and click
on submit. This will produce a list of all the current system wide variables
and their values. This includes the three that you edited before to get
netforum to run. Look thought the list and if any are incorrect for your system
or you are unsure about what any mean hit the <EM>Edit System Variables</EM>
button to edit the values. This will present you with a listing of all
the variables, their current values and a short explanation of what each does.
You can edit each of the values in the correspoding text area.
