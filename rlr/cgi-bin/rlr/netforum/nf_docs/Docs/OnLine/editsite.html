Edit Site Configuration</H2> 
<HR>

This adminsitrative option will allow you to mananage all the  
parameters of your site that allow NetForum to be configured
properly. 
<em>Only the site administrator or
someone with the right to administer NetForum</em> can enter to
this menu.
<BR>
The site parameters you can configure within NetForum include
your system configuration, the default forum configuration, and
the default header and footer for each forum.


<P>
<STRONG>Edit System Configuration</STRONG><BR>
Choose this option if you want to modify the system parameters.  
If you are able to run NetForum, it means that your basic system
parameters are configured correctly. 
You should have configured the system variables prior to running
NetForum. You can do this by editing the variables located in the <CODE>
sys_config</CODE> file within the <CODE>lib</CODe> directory.
The basic variables that 
allow NetForum to run are:
<UL>
<LI> $url <BR>
<LI> $base_url <BR>
<LI> $home_directory <BR>
<LI> $htdocs_path <BR>
<LI> $perl_path <BR>
<LI> $cgi_required <BR>
<LI> $docs <BR>
</UL>
You should not need to change them once NetForum is running. However, 
you may want to come to this menu to revise your settings or to
change the non-basic system variables. <BR>
Look in the <a href="configuration.html">configuration notes 
</a>for more information on these variables.
If you have problems configuring these parameters, contact your site
or system administrator for help.
<P>
<STRONG>Edit Global Forum Configuration</STRONG> <BR>
This option allows you to configure the default parameters for
all the <em>newly</em> created forums.  All the forums you create
will be configured with the parameters you set through this option.
<P>
If you need to change a particular forum's parameters, you will need
to do it through the <strong>Edit Forums</strong> option. If you 
want <em>all</em> your forums to use the same parameters, you
can disable forum configuration from the <strong>Edit System 
Configuration</strong> option. You will find a variable named 
<CODE>$allow_forum_config</CODE>. If you turn it off, all your
forums will use the default forum configuration. <P>
If you create a series of forums and later decide to change the
default forum configuration, only the new forums (the ones
you create after the change) will be affected.
The old forums will contain the <em>old</em> defaults. You will
have to change the old forum's parameters one by one or turn off
<CODE>$allow_forum_config</CODE> if you want the old forums to
use the new defaults.
<P>

<STRONG>Edit Default Header</STRONG><BR>
NetForum allows you to add a header to your forums. 
You can edit the default header for all the forums via this option.
When you create a new forum, it's header will be whatever you
set through this option. If you wish to change a particular 
forum's header, you will need to do it from the 
<strong>Edit Forums</strong> option. <P>
The header contains HTML text just like if you were to create 
a web page. The default header file is located inside the 
<code>lib</code> directory (in case you want to edit it
from outside NetForum) and the header files for the individual
forums are created within each forum's directory.

<P>
<STRONG>Edit Default Footer</STRONG><BR>
Works just like <strong>Edit Default Header</strong> except that 
you are editing the forum's footer. You can leave this file 
empty if you don't want any footer in your forums.
