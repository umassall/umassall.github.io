<h3><A NAME="1">Browsing</A></h3>
NetForum organizes postings into <b>forums</b>, <b>topics</b>, 
<b>messages</b>, and <b>replies</b>. When entering a forum, you are shown a 
list of topics. When you click on a <b>topic</b>, you are shown the most recent
<b>messages</b>, newest at the top. There are two possible views: compressed
mode where a single line consisting of the subject, author and date posted
is presented for each message. To view more information about a message click
on the subject. You can also expand all the messages by clicking on the 
<EM>expand button</EM>:

to provide your email and the institution you are at, depending on how

password-protected. In this case you must know the the correct username and
password pair in order to create a new forum.

information you entered before actually posting the topic. You may
repetitively edit and preview topic information in this way before

options, <A HREF="#14">HTML, Preformatted text, and Translated text</A>,

this forum</EM> toolbar item: 

<p>
<img border=0 alt="About this forum" src="../../gifs/button1/about.gif">

<P>
This will display the forum description, its
guidelines and group information.
A forum's description will also be shown when viewing the list of topics 
for the forum.
<p>
<hr>

<h3><A NAME="7">Groups</A></h3>
A forum might have a user group defined; in this case, you will see two 
toolbar items; one to view the list of group members, and one to send 
email to one or more members of the group.

<p>
<img border=0 alt="Show group Info" src="../../gifs/button1/group_info.gif">
<img border=0 alt="Send email to group" src="../../gifs/button1/email.gif">

<p>
Clicking on the first will give you a listing of the group for a particular
forum. The second will allow you to send mail to multiple members of the group

from the group list as you like. Write the message in the large text box and 
hit the submit button. See the section on sending email for more information.

<hr>

<h3><A NAME="9">HTML checking</A></h3>
When posting messages, topics, or replies, NetForum will do some basic 
HTML checking, and notify you before posting if there
are any unclosed tags. It will also prevent you from posting any tags that 
will hinder the reading of other messages. Those tags may include:

<ul>
<li> input
<li> textarea
<li> h1
<li> h2
<li> hr
<li> form
<li> input
<li> select
<li> option
<li> table
<li> isindex
<li> basefont
<li> tr
<li> td
<li> th
<li> caption
<li> body
<li> html
<li> head
<li> meta
<li> title
<li> blink
<li> img
</ul>


<hr>
<h3><A NAME="10">Forum Owners and Contacts</A></h3>
Each forum has an owner and a contact; both are listed at the top of the
page listing the topics. All contacts have email addresses listed; clicking 
on them will allow you to send them email directly.

<p>
<hr>
<H3><A NAME="13">Sending Email</A></H3>

Clicking on any link that looks like an email address will allow you to
send email to that address. Depending on how the site administrator has
set NetForum up there are two possible ways to do this. The first is the
standard browser supported email extension. To use this you must have your
browser correctly configured to send mail. See your browser documentation for
more information. Since almost all browsers support this facility most
NetForum site administrators will choose to have email sent in this manner.

<P>
The second is Net-Forum's built in mail facility. This requires that you
enter your name, email address, and the subject in the small text boxes 
provided. Type the message you wish to send into the larger text area. When
you are satisfied with your message hit the submit button. If you forget to
fill in a particular field NetForum will remind you of this and you can click
on your browsers back button to reedit the form. Otherwise you will be 
presented with a page confirming the email was sent. You can return to the
topic listing by click in the correct icon, unfortunately it is not possible
to return directly to a message listing in this version of NetForum.

<P>
<HR>
<H3><A NAME="14">Formatting Options</A></H3>

When you create a message, reply, or topic any comments you make can
be in one of three formatting options, HTML, Preformatted, or Translated.
Some sites may not have all of these options available.

<P>
Select the <b>HTML</b> option if you want your message to be posted as 
HTML. If you select this option, text
will be wrapped automatically but line feeds or carriage returns will have 
no effect.
<pre>Select the <b>Preformatted text</b> option if you want your
message to be posted as preformatted text.
If you select this option, text will be not be automatically
wrapped, but line feeds and carriage returns will show.
Preformatted text will also be shown in a fixed-width font.
The text you are reading is displayed in your browser as
preformatted text.</pre>
Selecting the <b>Translated text</b> option will post the text as HTML, 
but will do some basic HTML markup. 
It will: 
<UL>
a) translate all single blank lines to HTML line breaks ( &lt;br&gt; ) <BR>

b) translate all double blank lines to HTML 
paragraph delimiters ( &lt;p&gt; )<BR> 
</UL>




What does this mean if you couldn't care less about HTML? 
<UL>
a) Enter a single line break in your form text area, and there will be no effect in    the display in the browser window. <BR>
   b) Enter two line breaks in your form text area (i.e. leave a blank line), and the
   effect in the browser window display will be a simple line break. <BR>
   c) Enter three line breaks in your form text area (i.e. leave two blank lines), and
   the effect in the browser window display will be two line breaks (i.e. a blank
   line). <BR>

</UL>
