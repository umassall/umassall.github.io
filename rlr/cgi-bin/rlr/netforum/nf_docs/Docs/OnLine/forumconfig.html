<H2>Forum Configuration</H2>

<hr>
NetForum allows many of its parameters to be customized to your site.
There are two kinds of customization, forum specific and the site default.
In the absense of a forum specific setup the site default will take effect. 

<P>
<IMG SRC="/netforum/gifs/button1/edit_site.gif" ALT="Edit Site">
<IMG SRC="/netforum/gifs/button1/edit_forum.gif" ALT="Edit Forum">
<P>
To configure forum options for the entire site, choose, the 
<EM>Edit Site Config</EM> option from the Admin menu. Only those
forum managers with permission to administer NetForum can make these changes.
Then choose the 
<EM>Edit Global Forum Configuration</EM> from the menu. Any changes made here
will affect those forums which have not had their own particular configuration.

<P>
To edit a particular forum's configurable values choose the <EM>Edit Forum</EM>
icon from the admin list. Then, when you have found the forum that you want
to configure click on the radio button to the left of <EM>Configure</EM> and
click the <EM>Submit</EM> button. This will present the Configure Forum form.
Anyone who has permission to manage a particluar forum may configure it.
Note, you need to turn the <CODE>$allow_forum_config</CODE> variable on in
order to allow individual forum configurations.

<P>
In each case, if the forum already has a configuration defined for it,
you will be presented with a list of the current values of all of the 
configurable variables. If you wish to edit these click on the large button
at the bottom of the list. If the forum has no variables set for it, it will
use the system defaults. In this case there will be no preliminary list, only
the forum were you fill in the values. If you wish to keep the system 
configuration for a particular forum don't edit the variable fields and don't
hit submit.

<P>
The following is an account of the forum configurable variables and
what each does.

<P>
<CODE>$image_border</CODE><BR>
This variable controls the size of the border that is placed around icons
in NetForum. Some browsers support this others do not. We usually set it to
zero as the buttons in the toolbar are raised and don't require any border.

<P>
<CODE>$how_many_messages_expaned</CODE><BR>
This and its partner <CODE>$how_many_messages_compressed</CODE> determine
the number of messages that you see in each of the major viewing modes. We
suggest that you make this varable a multiple of the 
<CODE>$how_many_messages_compressed</CODE> or going between expanded and 
compressed mode will be a bit skewed. This or the next variable can be set
to -1 so that all of the messages are displayed.

<P>
<CODE>$how_many_messages_compressed</CODE><BR>
The value of this is the number of messages display at one time in compressed
mode.

<P>
<CODE>$gateway</CODE><BR>
The value of this variable will be added to the header of any email sent
by NetForum. If you are not using NetForum's builtin email mechanism you can
leave this blank.

<P>
<CODE>%format_types</CODE><BR>
You can turn on each of the three possible format types. Each type turned
on will allow NetForum users to choose from that format type when they compose
a message, reply, or comments to a topic. See the 
<A HREF="general.html#14">formatting options</A> in the 
NetForum usage page for more information.

<P>
<CODE>$default_formatting</CODE><BR>
Check the box of the formatting type you want set by default. Make sure that
it is one of the type you can included in the <CODE>%format_types</CODE>
section. See the <A HREF="general.html#14">formatting options</A> in the 
NetForum usage page for more information.

<P>
<CODE>$institution_required</CODE><BR>
Turning this variable on will require NetForum users to enter and institution 
when they compose a message or reply. Most sites choose to turn this off. Note,
turning this off does not remove the institution field from the options list
it simply makes it optional.

<P>
<CODE>$institution_field_name</CODE><BR>
This is the name of the "insitution" field that users fill in when posting
messages. Through this variable you can give the field a name. The name
can be "Organization", "Insitution", "University", or whatever seems more
convinient to the users of NetForum at your site. This variable defaults 
to "Organization".

<P>
<CODE>$preview_all</CODE><BR>
Turing this off will keep all messages from being previewed before they
are posted. This choice superciedes <CODE>$preview_topics</CODE>, 
<CODE>$preview_messages</CODE>, and <CODE>$preview_replies</CODE>, each of 
these only turn off previewing of one particular feature.

<P>
<CODE>$nf_mail</CODE><BR>
Turing <CODE>$nf_mail</CODE> on will make NetForum use its internal mail
sending mechanism. This means if you turn this on mail from NetForum will 
be sent to individuals from the machine that hosts NetForum. If that is not
possible (or you don't like that idea) turn this off. If this value is off,
the mailto: directive will be used instead.

<P>
<CODE>$subject_only</CODE><BR>
Setting this variable to one (1) will display the messages in compressed mode
by default.

<P>
<CODE>$allow_replies</CODE>
If you turn this off users cannot reply to a particular message. Instead
they must add new messages to a topic. Note, if this is turned off after 
replies have been added to a topic they will no longer be shown but are not
actually deleted.

<P>
<CODE>$email_messages_to_monitor</CODE>
When this variable is turned on, the forum contact will be notified whenever
a message or a reply is posted to the forum. The contact will receive the
actual message/reply by email with the name of the forum where the
message was posted.

<P>
<CODE>@no_no_tags</CODE><BR>
This is a list of tags that you can have netforum look out for. If netforum
detects these it will produce an errror message. Some tags commonly added
to this list: blink, img, applet, h1, h2, etc. You must separate entries
by commas.


<P>
<CODE>$show_admin_button</CODE><BR>
If this is set to on the admin button will show in the toolbar. Unless
you really need it we recommend you turn this off.


<P>
<CODE>$button_path</CODE><BR>
This will show a sample of each of the possible icon buttons for NetForum.
Choose the one you like best. You can create your own buttons for your site
to make NetForum match. <A HREF="#buttons">See below on how to do this</A>.


<P>
<h3>The "header" file</h3>
The header file  contains the html code that  NetForum 
will print at the top of every page. There are two kinds of
headers, the default header and forum specific headers. If a forum
does not have a particular header the default header will be displayed. 

Unfotuanely the word header is a misnomer, and it is not possible to put any
html tags that belong in the <STRONG>HEAD</STRONG> portion of a page 
in the header such as &#60META&#62 or &#60TITLE&#62. 
Instead  header files should begin with the <STRONG>BODY</STRONG> 
tag. 

Any HTML in this file will be displayed at the top of every NetForum page. 
You may want to
change this so it displays the <b>NetForum</b> GIF file ("title.gif") 
provided in the gifs directory.

<p>
NetForum does no checking for tags in the header file, make sure that
your html is correct. Any &#60BODY BACKGROUND&#62 and IMG tags may be included
to make netforum appear more like the remainder of your site.


<P>
You may either edit the header from your favorite html editor or from 
the NetForum admin page itself. To do the latter choose 
<EM>Edit Default Header</EM> from the Edit site configuration page. 
This will present you with a large text area that you can use to enter
your default header. 


<P>
<hr>
<h3>The "footer" file</h3>
Any HTML in this file will be displayed at the bottom of every NetForum page, 
immediately after the last &#60hr&#62. Like the header file there are
two kinds of footers. The default footer is used when there are 
no forum specific footers. It can be configured by selecting 
<EM>Edit Default Footer</EM>   from the Edit site configuration menu. Just
as in the case of the header you can enter any html you like in here. Commonly,
this is used to include links to other parts of your site. 

<p>
<HR>
<P><A NAME="buttons"></A>
<H3>Creating your own buttons</H3>
You can make your own buttons to further customize your NetForum site. To
do this create a directory beginning with <CODE>button</CODE> followed
by some unique part. Usually this is <CODE>buttonX</CODE> where <CODE>X</CODE>
is a number (larger than 3.) Place this directory with the other button
directories inside the <CODE>gifs</CODE> directory.
Look in one of the current button direcories to see the list of all the buttons
you need to create. After creating all of the buttons, the next time you run
the <EM>Edit Forum Configuration</EM> or the <EM>Edit Site Configuration</EM>
from the admin menu the buttons you created should be a new option. Click the
radio button next to them to select them.
