<h1>NetForum Version History</h1>

<HR>
<STRONG>Version 2.0.3</STRONG><BR>
Fixed problems in 2.0.2 and added additional documentation to the admin
script.<P>

<B>Bug Fixes</B>
<UL>
<LI> A problem occured when $preview_topic was turned off. It resulted
in a "divide by zero" message in the error_log of some servers. 
<LI> When configuring a forum and selecting different formatting types,
NetForum would use the selected formatting types but it would not
display them on the configuration page the next time a user configured
a forum.
<LI> Fixed a bug in which the word "Organization" would appear even though
no organization had been entered.
<LI> Fixed a bug in which some fields such as "Organization" and "Topic
description" would not appear on a new line when previewing message and
posting topics.
<LI> Fixed a problem with some browsers (such as Netscape 3.0) where 
annoying warnings would be displayed because of NetForum trying to use 
cookies. All the cookies' code has been commented out and we will delay
the usage of cookies on NetForum until we are able to test this feature
on different browsers and servers.
<LI> Renamed list_forum.gif to list_forums.gif in the button3 directory.
<LI> Cleaned up extra horizontal lines that were displayed at the end
of a list of messages.
<LI> Translated text now works as advertised.
<LI> Fixed a problem in the admin script where more replies than selected
would be deleted when editing a topic's messages.
<LI> Cleaned up the admin script code in various places, particularly in
managing forum owners.
</UL>

<B>New Features </B>
<UL>
<LI> Added additional on-line documentation to the admin script.
<LI> Added more descriptive email messages when forum contact gets 
notified of message/reply posting.
<LI> Forum contact can now also get notified when a topic is created.
</UL>

<STRONG>Version 2.0.2</STRONG><BR>
<UL>
<LI>Fixed a bug on the utilities script that did not allow the proper use of
-1 as $how_many_messages_compressed or $how_many_messages_expanded 
</UL>
<STRONG>Version 2.0.1</STRONG><BR>
Bug fixes to version 2.0.0 and some new features.<P>

<B>Bug Fixes</B>
<UL>
<LI> Topics' password protection feature now works properly.
<LI> Topics no longer conflict with each other when having more than
     10 topics. 
<LI> Added help throughout all the admin script.
<LI> Fixed backslash problem in admin script when using Perl5
<LI> Fixed problem when using NetForum mail where person's email
    would not be displayed.
<LI> Fixed bug that would display all replies at the beginning of
    messages when viewing in compressed mode (some versions of 2.0.0)
<LI> Problem when leaving organization field empty where message saying:
    "Cannot have an organization site without an organization field" has 
    been fixed.
<LI> Commented the $netforum_entry variable in the sys_config file. The 
    netforum.html file is not required so this variable does not have
    functionality. Perhaps we will use it in later versions.
</UL>

<B>New Features </B>
<UL>
<LI> Added one more configuration option where you can now send messages
and replies by email to the forum contact when they are posted through 
NetForum.
</UL>

<HR>

<STRONG>Version 2.0.0</STRONG><BR>
Major code revision and improvements.
<UL>
  <LI> Administrative functions from the web:
  Now the NetForum maintainer can work from the
  comfort of their own web browser. Delete
  forums, topics, and messages. Edit every
  possible forum/topic/message parameter.

  <LI> Allowing the user to change system variables from the admin
    script.

  <LI> Writing a perl/shell script that will install the whole
      thing. The
      administrators can use the administrative functions to set
      the remaining parameters.

  <LI> Forums can now be configured individually with a variety 
       of parameters.

  <LI> The program has been broken into several parts
	  now. All of the administrative functions are in
	  the admin script. All the variables are in their
	  own script and so are all of the "utilities,"
       functions used by every script.

  <LI> More meaningful error messages.
  </UL>
