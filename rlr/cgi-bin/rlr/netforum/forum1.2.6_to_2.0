# This script should be run AFTER NetForum 2.0.x is configured 
# some of the new configuration variables may be necessary.
# Before running this script, I recommend that you configure NetForum 2.0
# correctly and that it is tested using the test forum provided.
# Also, the forums corresponding to NetForum 1.2.6 should be COPIED NOT MOVED
# to the directory where NetForum 2.0.x is located. I recommend that 
# the forums (and its corresponding files/sub dirs) are copied 
# in case something goes wrong (so keep a backup of your old forums).
# The old responses and messages will be deleted from the NetForum 2.0
# directory and replaced with the new formatted ones. If something goes
# wrong, try copying the old forums again to the NetForum 2.0.x directory
# and run this script again.

# NOTE:
# After the script is done, you will need to copy the forum_config into the
# the new forums if this script was not able to do it for you.

# forum1.2.6_to_2.0 v1.8  9/10/96
# Author: Jose F. Siman 
# siman@biostat.wisc.edu

# Changes for 1.8
# Fixed a problem of changing dirs when the user left spaces 
# between commas and forum directories.
# Added a check to see if a forum had already been converted so that
# forumlist file did not contain duplicates.

# Changes for 1.7
# Added better handling of subjects of messages and replies
# which in some cases produced empty subjects

# Changes for 1.6
# Removed newlines and invisible characters from subject
# also, removed HTML tags (I think)

# Changes for 1.5
# May have fixed a bug that would not allow to do multiple forums at once?

# Changes for 1.4
# Fixed a bug that did not clear the number of messages and responses

# Changes for 1.3
# Fixed a bug that would not update the list file

# Changes for 1.2:
# Chmod to 0777 all files created

# Changes for 1.1:
# Subjects now contain the first 35 characters of the message
