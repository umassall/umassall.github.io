Description:

WWWWAIS is a small ANSI C program that acts as gateway between waisq
or waissearch (programs that search WAIS indexes) and a forms-capable
World-Wide Web browser. With the freely distributable freeWAIS package,
this program, and your local Web site, you can: 

 * Create searchable databases of the information on your Web site
 * Allow users to search multiple databases via their
   Web browser with customizable options
 * Create a custom pop-up menu of servers to search through
 * Produce hypertext search results, with file information and links
   directly to the relevant HTML documents
 * Retrieve WAIS source descriptions and files
 * Specify URLs and filters to map results to
 * Only allow users from certain sites to search documents

You can see how it looks at:
