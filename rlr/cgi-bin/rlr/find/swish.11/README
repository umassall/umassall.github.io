README for SWISH
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	Thanks for grabbing SWISH! To compile this for your
system:

	1) Go to the src directory and edit the default
           variables in "config.h" to your liking.
	2) Go back to this directory and type "make".
	3) Type "make test" for a simple indexing test.
           The file "test.html" in this directory will be
           indexed and searched. If it works, you'll see a
           message reporting success.

	Here's what else is included in this package:

	* In the doc directory, there is the SWISH icon
	  and the HTML documentation.
	* In this top directory, you'll find:

	  sample.swish - a sample index to play around with
	  swish.conf - a sample SWISH configuration file

The latest, most up-to-date SWISH documentation can be found at:
