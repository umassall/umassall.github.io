To Do
~~~~~

There still seem to be some problems with merging more than two
	large files at once...
It would be simple to add in a substring search, like *this*
	with a fast strstr, but I didn't have time...
The parser needs to be a bit more robust...
Multiple custom field search.
SWISH needs a man page.
The distribution could use a sample gateway program.
I need to double-check if multiple FileRules in multiple config files
	overwrite. They shouldn't...
Temp file cleanup could be better.
Could check for overwriting existing files.
I should make more command-line options override the config file!
Proximity, stemming, soundex.
File filtering.
Implement a memory limit option; SWISH then saves to disk every once
	in a while during indexing...
Run SWISH as a server?

Thanks!
