This document provides instructions for quickly executing some JAT agents.
<hr>
<h2>Execution Instructions:</h2>

<ol>
<li>
First, if you don't already have it, download the JDK 1.0.2. You
can get it at <A href="http://www.javasoft.com">JavaSoft's website</a>.
<li>
Next, download the Java(tm) Agent Template Version 0.3 distribution. <a
href="http://cdr.stanford.edu/ABE/java_agent.html">Click here to download</a>.
<li>
Unpack the compressed tar file: "zcat JAT_0.3.tar.Z | tar xf
-". This will create a directory titled JAT_0.3.
<li>
Set the execution parameters:<p>
JAT agents require a set of execution parameters which can be provided via
either applet parameters or commandline arguments. 
I have created a set of both C shell scripts and html pages for simplifying
the excution process. (If you want to execute the agents from the commandline
and are running this on either a 95, NT or MacOS machine you will have to
either manually specify the args or create appropriate scripts.) You will need
to modify both the html (contained in JAT_0.3/applet/) and script (contained in
JAT_0.3/scripts/) files to provide the correct values for these parameters.
(For Example 1, you will need to modify either the scripts or html pages for
the "Agent" and "ANS" agents. For Example 2, modifications must be made to the
files for the ServiceBroker, ServiceAgent, FDATAgent and ClientAgent agents).
The following parameters must be set:<p>
<ul>
<li>init_file: 
URL location of the initialization file. This file contains a
set of KQML messages which are "sent" to the agent at startup, one of these
messages must contain the location of the Agent Name Server (ANS).
<li>shared_classes: 
URL providing the remotely accessible location of the directory which contains
Java classes and general files which the agent will share with other
agents. This URL will be given to other agents so that they can retrieve
selected files. For agents executing on remote machines this URL must have the
http protocol; for agents all on the same host, the file protocol can be used.
<li>shared_dir:
Local path to the shared classes directory. This is used by the
agent to modify the contents of shared files. User must have write permission.
<li>working_dir:
Local path to a directory in which the agent can cache acquired/generated
files. User must have write permission.
<li>gui:
Determines if the agent will be executed with a graphical user interface.
These parameter can be set to false for agents which will be run as "daemon"
processes. (e.g. you want to run the ANS like a http server)
<li>name: 
String name for the agent.
<li>port:
Local port for the SocketInterface's ServerSocket. If set to 0, an open port
will be automatically selected.
</ul>
<li>
Change to the JAT_0.3/scripts/ directory.
Modify the env file to correctly set the CLASSPATH environment
variable to include the JAT_0.3/classes directory.
<li>
Modify the init_file to correctly specify the current host and port you want
the ANS to communicate through. (For example 2, the FDAT agent needs a 
special init_file: FDAT_init_file).
<li>
Execute an ANS and one or more Agents:<p>

To execute using the appletviewer: <P>

<ul>
<li>
If you want the agents to be able to perform local file IO, then you will have
to edit the ~/.hotjava/properties file ( or its equivalent on non-Unix
platforms) to include the lines:
"acl.write={some_dir}/JAT_0.3/working/:{some_dir}/JAT_0.3/files" and 
"acl.read={some_dir}/JAT_0.3/working/:{some_dir}/JAT_0.3/files", where
some_dir provides the absolute path to the JAT_0.3 directory. If this is not done
you must remove both the shared_dir and working_dir parameters from the
appropriate html file.
<li>
Source the env file: "source env".
<LI> Start the appropriate applet using the appletviewer: "appletviewer
&ltagent name&gt.html &amp;"
<LI> Press the "Create &ltagent name&gt" button to start the Agent.
</ul> <P>

To execute as a stand alone application:<P>

<ul>
<LI> Execute the Agent by executing the appropriate script: "&ltagent name&gt"
</ul> 
</ul>
