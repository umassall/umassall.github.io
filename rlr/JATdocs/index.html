If you are reading this you have either (1) downloaded and unpacked
version 0.3 (<a href="version.html">Why 0.3 instead of 3.0?</a>) of the Java
Agent Template (JAT_0.3) or (2) you are browsing through the JAT website
trying to decide whether you should download the JAT. <p>

Current documentation includes a brief overview of the JAT, a
set of instructions for quickly getting some JAT agents up and running, two
example scenarios, more
extensive architectural/functional descriptions for JAT developers (future
documentation efforts will focus on these pages), the javadoc
generated API pages and some information on support resources.
I have tried to inline as much information as possible
within the source code. Consequently, the API currently provides the most
detailed and thorough source of documentation. 
I recommend that everyone first read the quick start documentation and then
work through the two examples. I hope my
efforts are not completely confusing and have some utility to the
academic/industrial research community. Enjoy.<p>
