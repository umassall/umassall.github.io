<h1>Support Resources</h1><p>
<hr>
Current resources for developers include the <a
href="http://cdr.stanford.edu/ABE/JavaAgent.html">JAT website</a> and a JAT
mailing list: jat-develop@cdr.stanford.edu.  If you have a
question, please send it to the jat-develop mailing list.  Mail sent to
jat-develop will be received by a group of students at both Stanford and
Berkeley who are engaged in JAT development. Hopefully, one of the recipients
will be able to answer your question.  Although we hope to create a public
mailing list,
jat-develop mail is currenlty accessible only through a <a
href="http://cdr.stanford.edu/ABE/java_agent_template/hm/">
hypermail achive</a>.
