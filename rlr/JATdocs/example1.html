<H1>Example 1: Basic agents and resource retrieval.</H1> 
<hr> 

All JAT agents maintain both class and data resources using objects which
are subclasses of JavaAgent.resource.Resource. Java class resources include
languages (essentially protocol handlers, enable a message to be parsed
and provide some high level semantics) and interpreters (essentially
content handlers, provide a procedural specification of how a
message, constructed according to a specific ontology,
should be interpreted). (The interpreter is specified using the KQML
"ontology" field). It is assumed that the implementation of each Interpreter
class is based on some formal specification ("ontology") of the message
semantics.  One property of the JAT enables
these resources to be dynamically exchanged between Agents in a "just-in-time"
fashion (a subclass of Resource, RetrievalResource is utilized for this
purpose). This allows an agent to correctly process a message, whose language
and interpreter are both unknown, by dynamically acquiring the necessary Language
and Interpreter classes.  The following sequence of steps will illustrate this
functionality. (Keep in mind that although these examples have all of the
agents running on the same machine, the agents can theoretically run on any
Internet host which is not inside a firewall.)<p>

<hr>

Perform the following steps:<p>
<ol>

<LI> You need to have an ANS and at least two agents started. One agent will
act as "Agent 1" and the other as "Agent 2" (regardless of their actual
names).<p> 

The standard agent GUI includes a menu bar and a text area for displaying
system messages, each system message is also written to a log file 
(the log files are contained in the working directory for each Agent and are
titled with a time stamp).
The ANS, when created, will automatically bind a ServerSocket to the host/port
listed in the init_file. Each Agent will bind a ServerSocket to either the
user specified port or to an automatically determined port, after which the
Agent will attempt to send a registration message to the ANS. If you have been
successful, each Agent, including the ANS, will have received a single message
from the init_file and each Agent will have sent one message to the ANS. You
can look at the contents of the sent/received message buffers using the menu
bar command "Message->View". Go ahead and check out the other commands, but if
you decide to try the "Action->Quit" command, be prepared for the obvious
consequences.<p>

<LI> Select the "View" command under the "Resource" menu of the ANS. You
should see the addresses for the two Agents you started. You should also see
the "KQML" language and the "agent" interpreter. 

<LI> Select the "Load" command under the "Resource" menu of Agent 1.

<LI> Load the TestInterpreter interpreter. (Resource Name: test , 
Class/File Name: test.TestInterpreter, URL: &lt;location of the classes
directory&gt;). Execution of this command will use the NetworkClassLoader to
open an input stream to the TestInterpreter.class file, read in the byte codes
and load the class into the current run time. 

<LI> Select the "Compose" command under the "Message" menu of Agent 1.

<LI> Send the following message: performative: "evaluate", sender: will be
filled-in automatically, receiver: Agent 2's name, language: "KQML", ontology: "test", content: "(test2)".

<LI>A top-level window containing the label "Test 2" should appear.

</ol>

<hr>
Although this may seem like a very simple exercise, a somewhat complex series
of synchronized transactions were necessary to implement this
functionality. Here is what actually happened: <p>

<ul>

<LI>First, when Agent 1 attempts to send the first message, it will realize
that it does not have the address for Agent 2 so it will block the message
transmission and send a message to the ANS asking for the address of Agent 2. 

<LI>The ANS will get the ask-resource message from Agent 1 and will send back
the address of Agent 2.

<LI>After getting the address for Agent 2, Agent 1 will go ahead and send the
test message to Agent 2.

<LI> Agent 2 will receive the test message and realize that it does not have
the
test interpreter and is therefore unable to interpret the message.  Agent 2 will
therefore block interpretation of the message and attempt to send a message to
Agent 1 requesting the location of the TestInterpreter code. However,
Agent 2 does not have the address for Agent 1 so it will have to block the
message to Agent 1 and first send a message to the ANS requesting Agent 1's
address. 

<li> The ANS will receive Agent 2's request and will respond with the address
for Agent 1.

<li> Agent 2 will receive Agent 1's address and will proceed to send a
message to Agent 1 requesting the location of the TestInterpreter.

<LI> Agent 1 will get the ask-resource message from Agent 2 and will reply
with the location for the TestInterpreter (both url and absolute class name).

<LI> Agent 2, after getting the location of the TestInterpreter, will load the
code, create a new instance of the TestInterpreter class and finally interpret
the first message it received from Agent 1 (the KQMLmessage object will be
passed as an argument to the interpretMessage() method of the TestInterpreter
object).

<LI> The TestInterpreter will identify the language for the content field as KQML
and will thus parse the content field according to the KQML syntax (KQML
message within a KQML message).

<LI> Because the performative of the content is "test2" the test2Action()
method will be called. This method checks to see if the current agent has a
GUI and, if it does, passes an subclass of Panel up to the GUI. This is the
panel which gets displayed.

<LI> You can use the "Message->View" command in each agent to
see a record of the above mentioned messages.
