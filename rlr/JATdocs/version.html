<h1>0.3 vs 3.0</h1><p>
<hr>
The previous releases were given version numbers
1.0 and 2.0 respectively, so you might ask, "Why go to 0.3?". Well, after my
recent exposure to "commerial" software development, I realized that the JAT
is not even close to being 1.0 version software. Thus, the apparent version
degradation. Fundamental changes to nearly every aspect of the JAT were made
between the 2.0 and 0.3 versions. Accordingly, I have not tried to compile a
"Changes" list. If you have done development work with the 2.0 JAT, you will
have to undertake a fairly significant, but not impossible, port. (I had to do
it for six separate agent specializations) If you have problems with this
port please see the <a href="support.html"> Support section</a>.<p>
