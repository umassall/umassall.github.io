<H1>Example 2: The remote service specialization.</H1> 
<hr> 

The agents provided in the base JAT packages (Agent and ANS) are not intended
to be used as-is, but should be subclassed to provide some specific
functionality. The JAT_0.3 distribution includes an example JAT
specialization which supports the use of remote
services, managed by ServiceAgents, by a distributed group of
ClientAgents. The implementation for this remote service architecture is
contained in the RemoteService packages.
A ServiceBroker agent (ANS) serves as a repository for registered services, in
addition to its normal duties as an ANS. Each ServiceAgent, when started, will
register the group of services it manages with the
ServiceBroker. ClientAgents, when started, automatically retrieve the list of
available services from the ServiceBroker. Each available service can be
installed and executed by a ClientAgent via interaction with the
ServiceAgent. This architecture is generic and can support a wide range
of applications which can be represented by the remote service paradigm.<p>

This example utilizes the agents in the RemoteService package to demonstate
the registration, delivery and use of a sample remote service, the Fixture
Design and Analysis Tool (FDAT). The analysis portion of this service was
developed by CMU and is maintained on their network. I initially developed the
Java interface (FDATI) as an applet but decided that it would make a "cool"
example so reworked the code into a Service subclass. The FDAT provides
stability analysis for a set of motion constraints, or fixtures, on a
solid. Check out <a href="http://acorn.eit.com/softrep/java/FDATI.html">FDATI
pages</a> for more info. Basically, the interface will display a solid model
which the user can rotate, zoom and pan. Shift-clicking on the solid will add
fixture points. When the user feels like they have a stable plan they can
submit the fixture information to a cgi-bin script at CMU which interfaces
with the analysis code.<p>

Here is what you need to do:<p>

<ol>
<li> 
Make certain you have modified the appropriate scripts/html files.
<li>
Start a ServiceBroker by executing the "broker" script. This agent has a
specialized GUI with widgets for displaying available services. Note: this
GUIdoes not directly display the system messages; you must click on the
"System Messages" button to see the messages. 
<li> 
Start a FDATAgent by executing the "FDAT" script. A thumbnail representing
the FDAT service should be displayed in the "Services" canvas. If you click on
this icon, a description of the Service will appear below. This service will
be automatically registered with the ServiceBroker.
<li>
Start a ClientAgent by executing the "client" script. This agent will
automatically retrieve the available service from the broker. At this
point you should have three agents with the FDAT service icon displayed in each
GUI. 
<li>
Double-click on the FDAT icon in the ClientAgent GUI. This will install and
execute the FDATService object.  You should now see a top-level window
representing the FDATService. Select one of the three example models and press
the "Display Model" button. You should now see a separate top-level window
which displays the selected solid. Dragging the mouse across the screen will
rotate the solid, shift clicking on the solid will add fixture points. You can
also zoom, pan and change the display settings. Go ahead and try to design a
stable fixturing plan for one of the parts. When you are finished
creating the fixturing plan, click on the submit button. Submission results
will be shown in a top level window.<p>
</ol><p>

<hr>
OK, now here's how all of that actually happened:<p>
<ul>
<li> 
One of the messages in the init file for the FDATAgent instructs
the it to load the FDATService, as represented by its gif thumbnail and
description file. After reading in this message, the FDATAgent sent a
"register-service" message (defined in the "service" ontology) to the
ServiceBroker. Also contained in the FDAT_init_file was a "add-models"
message (defined in the "FDAT" ontology). This message informed the
FDATAgent of the location of a set of example solid models.
<li> 
The ClientAgent, when executed, automatically sent an "ask-avialable" message
(defined in the "service" ontology) to
the ServiceBroker, which replied with a "tell-available" message (defined in
the "service" ontology) containing the gif and description files for the
FDATService and the name of the FDATAgent. 
<li>
When the icon was double-clicked, the ClientAgent sent (after retrieving the
correct address) a "request-service"
message (defined in the "service" ontology) to the FDATAgent, which replied
with a "tell-service" message (defined in the "service" ontology) containing the location of the FDATService
code. The ClientAgent then loaded, instantiated and executed the service
code. When executed, the FDATService object loaded the "FDAT" ontology and
send an "ask-models" message (defined in the "FDAT" ontology) to the
FDATAgent, which replied with a "tell-models" message containing the names and
locations of the set of example models. The FDATService then loaded the model
files, parsed them to create "model" objects and finally opened the
FDATService GUI. 
<li>
When the submit button in the FDATService GUI was pressed, the FDATService
used the ClientAgent to send a submit-fixels message to the FDATAgent, which
in turn sent the fixels to the cgi-bin script at CMU. After receiving the
submission results from CMU, the FDATAgent sent an analysis-results message
back to the ClientAgent.
