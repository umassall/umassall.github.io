Important notes and gotchas on RLR:
-----------------------------------

1. The .html files which are added to automatically, including list.html
   (researchers), pubs.html, and whatsnew.html, must have permissions of
   777.  This is because the user the cgi script runs as is "nobody".

2. The main .html file, index.html, sets up frames only.  menubar.html is
   the file which defines the image map bar on the left hand side of the
   browser window, and rl-main.html is the introduction page.

3. The cgi scripts are in the directory /user/cgi/rlr

4. The search data needs to be updated periodically.  It is in the
   directory /user/cgi/rlr/search.  The program to update the search data
   is:
	 swish -c swish.conf  
   This will run thru the directory /user/web/htdocs/rlr, and all of its
   subdirectories, and create the file rlr.swish.  (Make sure that the
   permissions on rlr.swish are 644).

5. The access statistics program is in the stats subdirectory.
   accesswatch.pl is the program to run -collects daily stats. only.
