<h2>Adaptive Agent Resources</h2>
<img align=right src="imgs/tower.gif">
<p>The purpose of this web site is to provide resources for designing and
building adaptive agents.
<p><b>Agents</b> are programs that perform a goal on behalf of a user.  
<p><b>Adaptive agents</b> use machine learning techniques to achieve their
goal.

<h3>Agent building environments</h3>
<a href=http://www.networking.ibm.com/iag/iaghome.html>IBM's Agent
Building Environment (ABE)</a>

<h3>Standards under development for Multi-Agent Interactions</h3>
<p><a href=http://www.cs.umbc.edu/kse/kif/>Knowledge Interchange Format
(KIF)</a> - is a common language for expressing the content of a knowledge
base, and is being developed by the Interlingua Group of the Knowledge
Sharing Effort (KSE).  IBM's ABE (see Agent Building Environments)
suppports KIF.

<p><a href=http://www.cs.umbc.edu/kse/srkb/>Shared Reusable Knowledge
Bases (SRKB)</a> addresses the issue of facilitating consensus on the
content of
sharable knowledge bases, and is being developed by the Shared Reusable
Knowledge Bases group of the KSE.

<p><a href=http://www.cs.umbc.edu/kse/kqml>Knowledge Query and
Manipulation
Language (KQML)</a> was developed to address communication between two
knowledge-bases systems, or between a knowledge-based system and a
conventional database management system, and was developed by the External
Interfaces Group of the KSE.
