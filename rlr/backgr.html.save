<h3>Reinforcement Learning Repository at MSU</h3>
<h1>Background Information for those relatively new to RL</h1>
<ul>  
<li><a 
href=http://www-anw.cs.umass.edu/~mharmon/rltutorial/frames.html
target="_top">Mance 
Harmon's illustrated tutorial</a> is a good place to start if you are also
new to the area of Machine Learning.  It presents a conceptual framework
for RL.
<br><br>
<li>If you are familiar with Machine Learning but are new to RL,
<b>Reinforcement Learning: A Survey</b>
<a
href=http://www.cs.cmu.edu/Groups/reinforcement/papers/survey.ps.gz
target="_top"> (PS  
format</a> or
<a href=http://ftp.cs.brown.edu/people/lpk/rl-survey/rl-survey.html
target="_top">HTML 
format)</a> by Leslie Kaelbling, Michael Littman, and Andrew Moore
discusses the historical basis of the field, presents a broad
selection of current work, and details the central issues of RL. 
<br><br>
<li>A preview version of an RL textbook, called <a
href=http://www-anw.cs.umass.edu/~rich/book/the-book.html
target="_top">Reinforcement 
Learning, An Introduction</a> is being 
written by Richard Sutton and Andrew Barto, and should be available in
published form from MIT Press in December of 1997.
<br><br>
<li>An article called <a
href=http://envy.cs.umass.edu/People/singh/RLMasses/RL.html target="_top">How to Make
Software Agents Do the Right Thing: An Introduction to Reinforcement
Learning</a>, by Satinder Singh, Peter Norvig, and David Cohn, introduces
RL theory in the context of implementing software agents. 
<br><br>
<li><a href=terms.html>Glossary of terminology</a> used in RL.

<li><a href=http://www.cs.orst.edu/~tgd/cv/talks.html>A tutorial by Tom
Dietterich</a> of Oregon Sate.
