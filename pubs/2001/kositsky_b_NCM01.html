<b>Nonlinear Damping Dynamics and 
the Variability of Rapid Aimed Movements</b>,
Presented at 2001 Meeting on the

Seville, Spain.

<blockquote> 
It has long been noted that human attempts at repeated movement
are subject to considerable variability. While the nature of
this variability has been extensively studied and plays
important roles in some theories of motor control and motor
learning, little is understood about the processes by which the
motor control system generates variability having the observed
properties. A plausible explanation is that noise inherent in
the activity of the nervous system corrupts motor commands. But
it is not known how motor command variability interacts with
the dynamics of a movement to produce the observed patterns of
behavior. Most of the theories in the literature explain
properties of variability, such as speed-accuracy
relationships, in purely kinematic terms that do not take the
dynamic behavior of the motor plant into account. We describe a
set of computational experiments aimed at studying the
hypothesis that key properties of variability in fast reaching
movements are due to nonlinear dynamical properties of the
motor plant.

<p>
 
Specifically, we studied ballistic single degree-of-freedom
movements generated by a fractional-power damping model of the
plant driven by variable pulse-step motor commands. This model
is motivated by the nonlinear properties of muscles and spinal
reflex loops. After noting that dynamic models with linear
damping do not generate significant final position variability
under these conditions, we show that fractional-power damping
naturally produces both linear and logarithmic relationships
between movement velocity and endpoint variance.
Fractional-power damping gives rise to dynamic behavior that
includes a "stiction region": an extended region in the state
space where movement effectively stops away from the system's
equilibrium state. For each fixed control signal, the stiction
region has well-defined borders, and final position variability
can only take place within the stiction region. For an ensemble
of movements generated by noisy command signals, the
speed-accuracy relationship critically depends on the
proportion of movements that hit the inner area of the stiction
region versus the proportion of movements that undershoot or
overshoot the region, thereby effectively stopping on an edge
of the region. These results provide a new perspective on
possible mechanisms for both the linear and logarithmic
speed-accuracy relationships observed in reaching.
