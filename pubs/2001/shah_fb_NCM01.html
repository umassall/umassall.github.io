In order to produce a desired movement, the brain must select the set
of muscles that will be used to generate the appropriate joint
motions. This problem is made particularly difficult by the fact that
in many cases, different subsets of muscles may be used to produce the
same movement. The motor system is therefore faced with a problem of
redundancy that must be resolved. Hoffman and Strick (1999) recently
examined the role of several different muscles in the production of
two degree-of-freedom, step-tracking wrist movements involving
flexion/extension and radial/ulnar deviation in primates. It was
observed that agonist muscles were recruited as a function of movement
direction in a roughly cosine-like fashion, with a muscle's "preferred
direction" defined as the peak of the cosine fitted to the muscle's
activity pattern. Furthermore, the preferred direction for some
muscles differed significantly from the muscle's direction of action
(or pulling direction).

We present a model of muscle recruitment that selects wrist muscle
activation levels based on their ability to produce the desired
movement while minimizing the total effort required by all muscles to
implement the movement. Taken together, these two constraints lead to
a cosine-like recruitment of the muscles. The pattern of muscle
activation as a function of movement direction produced by the model
closely matches that produced by experimental EMG recordings (Hoffman
and Strick, 1999). The model also predicts differences in a muscle's
pulling and preferred directions. These differences are due to the
uneven distribution of the pulling directions of the six primary
muscles involved in these movements. The pulling directions of some
muscles are separated by gaps as large as 120 degrees. In these cases,
movements to targets within the gap require additional activation of
the two muscles whose pulling directions border the gap to compensate
for the work that these muscles must do against one another. This
leads to shifts of the muscle's preferred direction toward the gap. In
addition, the magnitude of the shift increases as the size of the gap
increases.
