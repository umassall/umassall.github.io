<b>ABSTRACT</b><BR><BR>
The adage <i>practice makes perfect</i> makes for sound advice when
learning a novel motor skill. Be it typing a new password or hitting a
forehand in tennis, proficiency increases with experience. Behavioral
changes associated with motor skill acquisition can be broken down
into three broad categories: 1) movements are executed faster and
become more coordinated, 2) they come to rely on sensory information
gained while executing the task, rather than just sensory information
used during initial stages of learning the task, and 3) they seem to
be executed with less conscious thought and attention. In addition,
neural activity changes: many imaging and neural recording studies
suggest that with experience, control is transferred from cortical
planning areas to the basal ganglia. The two areas are thought to
employ different learning and control schemes.  In general, planning
can quickly take new information into account to make reasonable
decisions, but its control mechanisms have large computational
requirements. The basal ganglia use a simpler and less computationally
expensive control scheme, but they require much experience before they
can produce reasonable behavior.

In this thesis, I contribute to answering the question, ``what goes on
during practice?'' More formally, I am interested in the mechanisms by
which motor skills are acquired. I take a theoretical approach in that
I hypothesize a multiple controller scheme, based on the learning and
control mechanisms of cortical planning areas and the basal ganglia,
and test it with simulations designed emulate generic motor skill
tasks.  Because skill proficiency increases with experience, I am
particularly interested in the role of the experience-dependent
mechanisms of the basal ganglia in motor skill acquisition. Thus,
learning mechanisms attributed to cortical areas are artificially
restricted so that any change in model behavior is attributed to the
learning mechanisms of the basal ganglia.
<BR><BR>
Model behaviors exhibit characteristics indicative of motor skills,
supporting the plausibility of the multiple controller scheme as one
used by our nervous system and suggesting that the learning mechanisms
of the basal ganglia can contribute to developing most
characteristics.  In addition, I show how the strategies developed by
the models are functionally advantageous, providing a reason why such
a scheme may be used.
