In executing a voluntary movement, we are faced with the problem of
translating a specification of the movement in task space (e.g. a
visual goal) into a muscle recruitment pattern. Among many brain
regions, the primary motor cortex (MI) plays a prominent role in the
specification of arm and hand movements. Early experiments suggested
that individual MI cells contribute to movements in a visual-centered
(or extrinsic) coordinate system (Georgopoulos et al.,
1982). Subsequent experimental and theoretical work have argued for a
muscle-centered encoding of movement by MI cells.  However, in a
recent two-dimensional wrist step tracking experiment, Kakei et
al. (1999) observed both extrinsic-like and muscle-like task-related
cells in MI. This result was interpreted as evidence for a cascade of
transformations within MI from an extrinsic representation of movement
to a muscle-like representation.  In this poster, we present a model
which examines the complexity of the transformation from the extrinsic
visual space to the intrinsic muscle space that implements the wrist
movements on which Kakei et al. (1999) focused.  We demonstrate that,
given a realistic extrinsic-like representation of movement, a simple
linear network is capable of representing the transformation from the
extrinsic-like cells to the necessary muscle activation pattern. This
suggests that cells exhibiting extrinsic-like qualities can be
involved in the direct recruitment of spinal motor neurons. These
results call into question models that presume a serial cascade of
transformations that terminates with MI pyramidal tract neurons (PTNs)
that vary their activity exclusively with muscle activity.
