<h2>Machine Learning for Spectroscopy</h2>

<p>
Spectroscopy is the process of measuring the intensity of radiation emitted by a sample as a function of frequency.
Spectra are obtained by shining some type of input radiation on the sample and using a spectrometer to capture the energy that is emitted by the sample in response.
Different types of spectroscopy use specific energy sources and wavelengths, but in general,
they all produce output in the form of (<em>x</em>,<em>y</em>) data where <em>x</em> is the energy range and <em>y</em> is peak intensity.
Traditional methods for data interpretation in spectroscopy  commonly use individual peaks that are known to give rise to specific phenomena.
For example, when visible light shines on a sample containing the element calcium,
electrons are initially excited from low to higher-energy orbitals in the structure,
and then eventually those photons are given off and light of specific energies diagnostic of the spacings between the orbitals in Ca (e.g., 422.673 nm) is given off.
For decades, the area of a curve fit to this line has been used to calibrate different types of spectrosopic measurements that measure Ca.
However, in many types of spectrosocpy, the composition of the entire sample influences each individual peak in a complex way called &quot;matrix effects.&quot;
Univarate models for individual peaks cannot begin to represent the resultant changes in peak intensity.
Machine learning techniques provide alternatives to this traditional approach by utilizing data from the entire energy range collected.
</p>

<p>
Therefore, in the ALL, we've been developing new methods to process and interpret spectroscopic data from a variety of sources.
Most of these techniques are applicable to any form of spectroscopy.
Current domains of interest include laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS), Raman, FTIR, and x-ray absorption (XAS) spectroscopies.
</p>
<p>
In general, the machine learning tasks fall in two overlapping categories:
<b>classification</b> (which spectra match other spectra?), and
<b>composition</b> (how do peak intensities relate to the abundances of the elements/molecules that give rise to them?).
Both tasks share a number of issues, including:
</p>

<h3>Availability of Spectra Libraries with Standard Data</h3>
<p>Development of ML models requires training and test data sets of spectra of standard materials.
Although spectral data rthemselves have high dimensionality, and may have thousands of channels per spectra,
the number of spectra of standard materials is often limited,
and frequently does not come close to fully representing the possible variations in n-dimensional space.
For example, LIBS data (6144 channels per spectrum) are used to predict 30 different compositional variables,
but the number of standard spectra available to build predictive models is less than 1000 total.</p>

<h3>Data Preprocessing</h3>
<p>
Different types of spectroscopy all come with uncertainties that require spectral preprocessing.
Chief among these are <b>wavelength calibration</b>, which influences the correspondence between data channels and energy ranges,
and <b>normalization</b>, which affects how peak intensities vary between instruments, or even runs on the same intsrument.
These factors can make spectra from identical samples differ in scale and translation, among other effects.
Our lab is working to develop new preprocessing steps to reduce or eliminate these effects, leading to improved classification accuracy.
</p>

<h3>Improved Distance Metrics</h3>
<p>
When classifying a sample based on its spectrum, it is usually necessary to tell how different one spectrum is from another.
Spectra are often represented as points in a high-dimensional space,
which enables cheap comparisons via standard distance metrics,
but also presents problems due to the curse of dimensionality.
Heterogenous data is also difficult to coerce into this high-dimensional representation.
In response to these shortcomings, our lab has focused on more sophisticated measures of distance between spectra.
</p>

<p>
One such approach involves characterizing the manifold(s) on which our high-dimensional spectra lie.
This manifold learning problem enables several useful analyses, including the transfer of knowledge between spectroscopy datasets.
</p>

<p>
Another approach discards the high-dimensional point representation in favor of viewing spectra as an ordered sequence of two-dimensional points.
This "trajectory" representation enables the use of graph-based algorithms while avoiding the resampling and band-cropping that other representations require.
