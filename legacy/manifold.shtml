<h2>Manifold Learning</h2>
<p>
Many algorithms can be improved by first learning the structure of input data,
then operating on it in the context of a low-dimensional manifold.
The ALL applies these "manifold learning" techniques to a variety of algorithms and applications.
</p>

<h3>Manifold Alignment</h3>
<img src="img/manifold_aln.png" align="right" />
<p>
Manifold alignment is the task of finding correspondences between two or more data sets by considering inter-set similarity in manifold space.
The ALL has explored a wide variety of approaches to this problem,
featuring both linear and nonlinear embeddings with one-shot or multi-step aligment.
</p>
<p>
While most of our manifold alignment algorithms are based on solving a generalized eigenvector problem,
more recently we have explored a regression formulation of the problem.
This new class of alignment algorithms enables the use of regularization techniques (like an L1 penalty) to improve model sparsity and generalization ability.

<h3>Manifold Warping</h3>
<p>
Many interesting real-world data sets are inherently sequential:
text documents, social network activity, audio/video streams,
mobile robot trajectories, and more.
Manifold warping extends the above alignment techniques to exploit this structure,
preserving both the data's ordering semantics and manifold structure while finding inter-set alignment.
