Abstract:

<blockquote><i>
This report describes a set of computational experiments aimed at 
studying movement variability and speed-accuracy trade-off 
relationships for dynamic models with nonlinear damping. We analyzed 
ballistic movements with noisy control signals and noisy plant dynamics.
Most of the theories suggested so far to explain observed speed-accuracy 
relationships are purely kinematic and do not take into consideration 
the dynamic behavior of the system in question. A dynamic model with 
fractional-power damping is motivated by biological evidence and allows 
a completely new view of the speed-accuracy trade-off phenomenon. This 
model gives rise to a dynamic behavior called a stiction region.

<p>

Data obtained from our simulations make a good fit with the linear 
speed-accuracy relationship model. The speed-accuracy relationship 
critically depends on the proportion of movements that hit the inner 
area of the stiction region versus the proportion of movements that 
undershoot or overshoot the region, thereby effectively stopping on an 
edge of the region. These results provide a new perspective on possible 
mechanisms for both the linear and logarithmic speed-accuracy 
relationships observed in reaching.
